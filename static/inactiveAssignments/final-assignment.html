<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For this assignment you will be using the Human Connectome Project. It comes in 3 different files and has a corresponding data dictionary (where it explains what each variable means)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assignments/hcp-demos.csv"><i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> <code>hcp-demos.csv</code></a></li>
<li><a href="/assignments/hcp-personality.csv"><i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> <code>hcp-personality.csv</code></a></li>
<li><a href="/assignments/hcp-cognitive.csv"><i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> <code>hcp-cognitive.csv</code></a></li>

<h4>About the HCP Dataset</h4>
<p>The Human Connectome Project (HCP) was a landmark study for cognitive neuroscience, headed by Wash U and the University of Minnesota. It is a large-scale multi-center project that enabled the study of individual differences in neural functioning that subserve higher-order cognitive functions (Van Essen et al., 2013). The HCP collected <em>a ton</em> of data on 1200 participants, including genetic, physiological, self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, and task activation functional MRI). This makes it among the largest and richest publicly available cognitive neuroscience datasets in existence.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this class and this final project, I am providing you with an extremely pared down version of this dataset, with several changes associated with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the subject IDs have been changed</li>
<li>Many participants were randomly removed to ensure that it’s different from the original. It also will save you some computational resources. You have access to a random selection of 100 participants out of 1200.</li>
<li>Some of the values have been replaced with other values so as not to be able to backtrace anything</li>
</ul>
<p>You should use the data dictionary for more information on each column.</p>
<p>You can find the grading rubric on Canvas. This assignment is worth <strong>15 points total</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the 4 sections are worth 3.75 points each in total</li>
<li>2.5 of the points will be for accuracy (including code and interpretations)</li>
<li>1.25 points will be for pretty code (is it easy to read, do your naming conventions make sense, do you go to new lines when appropriate, is it easy to reproduce your code etc.).</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<ul>
<li>You MUST use a RNotebook for this assignment. You will submit 3 files:
<ul>
<li>The knitted .html file (do <em>not</em> turn in a <code>nb.html</code> file)</li>
<li>Your working .Rmd file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should write your code following the principles of open science and reproducibility. That is, you need to write your code in a way that other people can understand and reproduce your code. <strong>Think carefully about what is needed for someone else to reproduce your code!</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>I <strong><em>strongly</em></strong> suggest that you read through the entire assignment <em>before</em> starting. Good luck!</p>

<div id="part-1-data-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1 – Data Wrangling</h2>
<div class="list">
<ul>
<li>Load in whatever packages you’ll be using for the rest of the assignment (I do not want to see loading packages anywhere else in your final document except Part 1)</li>
<li>Import the 3 datasets</li>
<li>You must tidy them up so that they are merged into a single data.frame that looks like the image below. It must look exactly like this! No extra columns, no weird names etc. The column names must match what you see in the image. The format of your columns must also match (especially <code>Subject</code> and <code>Age</code> columns). Please see below for hints on how to do this.</li>
<li>Call your data.frame <code>hcp</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s what it needs to look like:</p>
<p><img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/example.png" /></p>
<div id="hints-for-part-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Hints for Part 1</h4>
<p><strong>Demographic Dataset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This one contains socioeconomic status values. You are not concerned with those values. You only want <code>Subject</code>, <code>Gender</code>, and <code>Age</code> columns.</li>
<li>At some point, you might need to use the following line in your code. You should copy/paste this directly. Where you put it is up to you. It replaces dots with dashes. <code>mutate_at(vars("Age"), ~str_replace(string = ., pattern = "\\.", replacement = "-"))</code> <em>(please note that you don’t have to use this, but depending on the approach you take, you might find it helpful)</em></li>
<li>One of the age groups should be <code>36+</code>. You might need to recode a variable in order to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cognitive Dataset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All of the cognitive tasks used a form of counterbalancing. Participants were assigned to be in either group A or group B. Each participant was only assigned to 1 counterbalance group (that is, if subject 1 was assigned to counterbalance group A, they were in that same group for all of the cognitive tasks).</li>
<li>You don’t care about the counterbalancing and do not want to keep it in your final dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personality Dataset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing extra here. Normal tidying.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Hints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are going to get rid of <code>NA</code> values, be extremely mindful of when you do this</li>
<li><code>tidyverse</code> functions can have suffixes like <code>_at</code> and <code>_if</code></li>
<li>You must merge each of these 3 datasets into a single data.frame. We didn’t go over this explicitly, but part of this class is being able to use Google effectively. My tip is that if you are using one framework (like <code>tidyverse</code> vs. <code>base R</code>), stay in that framework while merging.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="part-2-describing-your-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 2 – Describing Your Data</h2>
<p>Pick 5 of the variables from the dataset that you find particularly interesting for the following section. Your job is to explore each of these 5 variables individually (that is, you are <em>not</em> looking at the relationship between any of these variables).</p>
<div class="list">
<ul>
<li>Make a figure showing if the variable is normally distributed. This should be a single figure with 5 subplots (do not overlay onto the same figure and do not make 5 individual plots; yes, we 100% went over how to do this)</li>
<li>Write some formatted text describing your results (aka text to accompany the figure, like you would in a manuscript)</li>
<li>Report at least 1 measure of central tendency and 1 measure of variability. Put these in the figure itself (top or bottom corner).</li>
<li>To accomplish this goal, you <em>must</em> use <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>HINT: There’s a very easy way to do this, but you need to think about the layout/format of your data.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="part-3-statistical-modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 3 – Statistical Modeling</h2>
<p>Pick 3 independent variables and 1 dependent variable and run a multiple regression. This is the same as a simple (univariate) regression, but now you have more predictors. Do NOT run any interaction terms. Pick your variables based on a hypothesis you have about these data.</p>
<div class="list">
<ul>
<li>In formatted text, describe the hypothesis. What are you testing?</li>
<li>Run the analysis in a code chunk and print out the results</li>
<li>In formatted text, interpret the findings. Note when you have more than 1 <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in your regression – excluding the intercept – we add the phrase <em>“holding all other predictors constant”</em>.
<ul>
<li>Interpret each regression coefficient</li>
<li>Interpret the omnibus test</li>
<li>Interpret the model fit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One of the assumptions of regression is that the fitted values (meaning the predicted values) should not correlate at all with the residual values. If you plot them, there should be a very flat horizontal line at 0. That’s because the fitted (aka predicted) values include the exact same residuals in their predictions. However, if you see that there is a correlation between the fitted and residual values, that indicates that your regression has some issues (could be a number of different things, including a missing predictor). Plot the fitted (X-axis) vs. residuals (Y-axis) and describe what you see. Do this using <code>ggplot2</code> not <code>base R</code>. HINT: you will need to extract both fitted and residuals values. Yes, we 100% went over ways to get these.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="part-4-simulating-power" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 4 – Simulating Power</h2>
<p>In Psychology and Neuroscience, we aim for 80% statistical power. You are going to simulate the power of the omnibus test of the regression you ran above.</p>
<div class="list">
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to simulate data for all IVs and DVs. Pick the simulation function based on the original data. Think carefully about the output of <code>rnorm()</code> vs. <code>rpois()</code> vs. any other function you are considering. When simulating the data, you want the simulated variables to have the same properties as the original variables. That is, you should get different individual values, but if you looked at the summary statistics of the simulated data and the original data, they should be very similar.</li>
<li>You will run your regression with your simulated data 5000 times such that you get an output vector of 5000 values. You are NOT simulating anything else from the regression.
<ul>
<li>HINT: go back to the mini assignments and look for clues</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In formatted text, describe:
<ul>
<li>What is statistical power? Why is it important?</li>
<li>What was the power of this regression you ran in the section above? Interpret it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="congratulations" class="section level5">
<h5>CONGRATULATIONS!</h5>
<p>Once this is submitted, you will have officially completed the class. Thank you for a wonderful semester! You’ve all worked really hard, and hopefully you feel like you’ve gained a new, useful skill. You can always email me if you have <code>R</code> or stats related questions. Keep in touch and best of luck!</p>
