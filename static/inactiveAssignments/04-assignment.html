<div id="congratulations" class="section level2">
<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>By this point, you have learned a <em>ton</em> about <code>R</code>. In this assignment, I want you to make something that you might actually use in your real life. So you will be making your own summaries of the things you’ve learned in this course – it will basically your own cheatsheet or crib sheet. Something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/cs.png" width = "100%">
</center>
<div id="requirements-for-the-structure-of-the-document" class="section level3">
<h3>Requirements for the structure of the document</h3>
<p>Create a <code>.Rmd</code> file (either RNotebook or RMarkdown is fine). When you turn in the assignment, I want you to submit <strong><em>BOTH</em></strong> the <code>.html</code> file <strong><em>and</em></strong> the <code>.Rmd</code> file. You are free to choose the topics – it can be anything we’ve covered!</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list (e.g., your file must include the following):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 large headers (at least) indicating the 3 topics you’ll go through</p></li>
<li><p>There must be (at least) 2 subheaders. They can both be under the same large header, or you can split them up.</p></li>
<li><p>You must have some normal text with a sentence or two that describes the topic and/or gives notes to yourself. Within the normal text, there should be both <strong>bolded</strong> text and <em>italicized</em> text.</p></li>
<li>There must be <em>at least</em> one code chunk per section that shows examples of the topic with code (see the above picture).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level3">
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This assignment is not meant to be very difficult, just something you might find helpful. So think back on the past few weeks, and identify some topics that you struggled with. Those are the ones that should go in this document (so hopefully you won’t struggle with them in the future!). Some topics you can think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexing</li>
<li>Logical operators</li>
<li>How to use functions</li>
<li>Specific functions</li>
<li><code>tidyverse</code></li>
<li>Statistical analyses</li>
<li>Plotting with <code>ggplot2</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="so-so-wonderful" class="section level3">
<h3>So, so wonderful!</h3>
<p>Submit your <code>.Rmd</code> and <code>.html</code> file to Canvas.</p>
</div>
