## Testing Things
The first part is going to be a test run to see if a particular type of document works with your computer. It should, but we're going to test it out here just in case. You do NOT need to submit the test file. 

#### WARNING
The following section requires the internet. Please make sure you have a stable connection before completing the exercise. __PLEASE tell me *as soon as possible* if any errors come up.__ This will be a large part of what we will be doing next week, so if it's not working, we need to get it worked out *__BEFORE__* you continue on to the Reproducibility section.

**PLEASE READ ALL OF THE STEPS BELOW _BEFORE_ ACTUALLY TRYING IT**. Follow these steps:

### Step 1
**In your console** set your working directory somewhere. It doesn't really matter where, as long as you can easily find it.

### Step 2
Next, open a new R Notebook. You can do this via `File > New File > R Notebook` or by clicking the white paper with <font color='green'>green plus sign</font> from the top left corner (this is the same as opening a new R script) and choosing R Notebook. It should look something like this:

<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm1.png" width = "70%">
</center>

### Step 3
Next, find the button at the top that says `Preview` and click the arrow next to it. You should get a drop down menu. Select `Knit to HTML`. It should look like this:

<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm2.png" width = "50%">

<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm3.png" width = "70%">
</center>

It will prompt you to save the file. That's OK! Give it a name like `testNotebook` or whatever you'd like.

### Step 4
Finally, you should see something that pops up, and it should look like this:

<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm4.png" width = "70%">
</center>
    
As long as the final thing shown above popped up, you're good! It's ok if you see a lot of scary stuff in the console after. But, if the thing above did *not* pop up, please take a screen shot of the scary console text! It will be easier for me to help you if I can see the message. Scary text that is actually OK might look like:

<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm5.png" width = "70%">
</center>

## Actual Assignment

### Introduction: Script Prep
Open a new script file and complete this assignment (the same way you've been doing for previous assignments). 

:::list
Here's your to-do list:

  - At the top of your script, read in your dataset, load in the `tidyverse` package, and make a comment that confirms that the above test run thing worked. 
:::

### Methods: Data Wrangling
Let's practice with data wrangling. Everyone's data is different, so this might depend on what you're working with.

:::list
Here's your to-do list:

  - Make a `tidyverse` code chunk that uses *at least __3__* `tidyverse` functions. Do whatever you think makes the most sense.
:::

Here's a list of some of the common `tidyverse` functions that you might want to use:

  - `pivot_wider`
  - `pivot_longer`
  - `filter`
  - `separate`
  - `unite`
  - `mutate`
  - `select`
  - `arrange`
  - `rename`
  - `recode`
  - any of the `join` functions (see cheatsheet for more)

### Results

Let's make a plot with error bars!

:::list
Here's your to-do list:

  - Make a smaller data.frame that contains all the information you would need to make a bar graph (including information for error bars of +/- 1 standard deviation) for *at least __two__* of your categorical variables.
  
  - Then, use the plotting code below and replace the missing values with your data so that you can actually make the bar graph!
:::

Here's a HINT:

  - The hardest part of this is trying to imagine what it is that you need!
  - You need a continuous variable that you can collapse into a value per level of each of your two categorical variables. Then you need to calculate everything needed for the error bars.

Here's the plotting code that you can copy/replace your data with

```{r, eval=FALSE}

XXX-1: correct data.frame
XXX-2: one of the two categorical variables
XXX-3: the summarized continuous variable
XXX-4: the second of the categorical variables
XXX-5: the value of the lower edge of the error bar
XXX-6: the value of the upper edge of the error bar

ggplot(data = XXX-1, aes(x = XXX-2, y = XXX-3, fill = XXX-4)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = XXX-5, ymax = XXX-6),
                position = position_dodge(width=.9),
                width = .2)

```

### Fantastic work!
Don't forget to submit your code and data file to Canvas.
