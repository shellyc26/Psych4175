This time we will work with the palmer penguins dataset.

If you want to install this on your own computer, you can run the following code. It is already installed for the purposes of this website:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Let's take a look at our dataset!

```{r}
# store it as an object so we can work with it
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
kable(head(penguins))
```

## Continuous Predictor

:::puzzle

**You try!**

Write a regression model and print the output for body mass in penguins predicted by bill length
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("learnr",
                    url = "https://shelly-cooper.shinyapps.io/25-learnr-app1/",
                    id = "learnr-25-app1")

```

Let's **interpret** those coefficients!

- What does the estimate for the intercept mean?
- What does the bill length estimate mean? 
- How could you calculate the $t$-statistic if it was not part of this output? 


:::puzzle

**You try!**

Now we're going to do the following:

- Make the output prettier
- Add on extra stuff, like predicted values
- Look at fit statistics

:::


```{r, echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("learnr",
                    url = "https://shelly-cooper.shinyapps.io/25-learnr-app2/",
                    id = "learnr-25-app2")

```

What if our units are hard to interpret? Maybe we want to examine things in the context of standard deviation. No problem! We can standardize things!

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(scale(body_mass_g) ~ scale(bill_length_mm),
           data = penguins)
summary(mod2)
```

For a 1-SD increase in bill length, we expect weight to increase by $b1$. 

## Categorical Predictor

Now what happens when we enter a categorical variable as a predictor? 

:::puzzle

**You try!**

Create a new model called `mod3` that looks at how body mass differs by whether penguins are male and female

:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("learnr",
                    url = "https://shelly-cooper.shinyapps.io/25-learnr-app3/",
                    id = "learnr-25-app3")

```


Let's **interpret** those coefficients!
- What does the intercept mean?
- What does the slope mean?


Let's get more familiar with OLS estimation and play a fun guessing game

## Reporting Regression

There are many ways of reporting your models - R conveniently has some packages that make publishable tables for you. Here is an example 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("apaTables")
mod1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins)
apaTables::apa.reg.table(mod1)

sjPlot::tab_model(mod1)
```


Something that was missing from the `lm` output -- Confidence Intervals. Journals often want them reported so here is a quick way of getting them (if not using a table package that gets them for you automatically)

```{r}
confint(mod1)
```

When plotting using `ggplot2` you'll also get a confidence band

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = body_mass_g, x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Confidence Band",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

What do you notice in this plot? 

Lastly, confidence bands are a little different from prediction bands. A confidence band is basically your confidence interval around the regression line. A prediction band:

- We are predicting and individual score, not the $\hat{Y}$ for a particular level of $X$
- Because there is greater variation in predicting an individual value rather than a collection of individual values (i.e., the mean) the prediction band is greater

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguinsSmall = penguins %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm) %>% 
  drop_na()

temp_var <- predict(mod1, interval = "prediction")
new_df <- cbind(penguinsSmall, temp_var)
ggplot(new_df, aes(y = body_mass_g,
                           x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr),
              fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Prediction Band vs. Confidence Band",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")

```
