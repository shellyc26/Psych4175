# Last time
- `ggplot` is built on **LAYERS**
  - Layer 1: `ggplot(data =   , aes(x =   , y =  )) +`
  - Layer 2: `geom_something(size =   , aes(color =   ))`
  - Layer 3: `labs(x = "x-axis label", y = "y-axis lable")`
  
- `geom_` controls the shape of the data points
  - `geom_density` for density plots
  - `geom_point` for scatter plots
  - `geom_bar` for bar plots, etc...

- Aesthetics control something in that particular layer
  - If it comes from the data, wrap it inside `aes()`
  - If not, no need for the `aes()`
  - Aesthetics we looked at: `size`, `color`, `fill`, `alpha`

# Today

Customizing our plots
  - Color palettes
  - Themes
  - Manually changing things in your plot

# Color Palettes
These can be very useful:

  - You have a TON of data and want to maximize the differences between colors
  - You want your colors to scale from dark to light (or vice versa)
  - You want to use colors that are colorblind friendly
  - You're bored of the default `ggplot2` colors
  
--

The most popular collection of palettes comes from a package called `RColorBrewer`. If you don't already have this installed, please do so now.

---

# `RColorBrewer` Palettes
All of the color palettes available through `RColorBrewer` (and to view this yourself):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all()
```

<center>
<img src="17-slides_files/figure-html/colpal.png", width = "100%">
</center>

---
# `RColorBrewer` Palettes
You don't have to stare at all of these. See if they fit your specifications. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# find palettes with 10 colors that are color blind friendly
display.brewer.all(n = 10, colorblindFriendly = TRUE)
```

<center>
<img src="17-slides_files/figure-html/colpal2.png", width = "100%">
</center>
---

# `RColorBrewer` Palettes
Once you know the name of the palette you want to use, you add a **LAYER** with the info

.pull-left.pull-left-small[
.code-small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = empire,
       aes(x = name,
           y = mass)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PRGn") #<<
```
]
]

.pull-right.pull-right-large[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = empire,
       aes(x = name,
           y = mass)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PRGn") 
```
]

---
# `RColorBrewer` Palettes

- The format is `scale_SOMETHING_brewer`
- `SOMETHING` needs to match the aesthetic
- We used `fill`, so it's `scale_fill_brewer`
- If you used `color`, it would be `scale_color_brewer`

---

# Want more color palettes?
There are seriously **_TONS_** of color palettes available to you. Some are great, and some are kind of ridiculous. Examples:
  - Wes Anderson themed palettes (check it out [.url[here]](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson#wes-anderson-palettes))
  - The package `ggsci` contains color palettes for scientific journals & sci-fi TV shows. See [.url[here]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html#futurama).
  - For a complete list, check out [.url[this Github repo]](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes).

# Themes

Themes change the *entire look* of your plot. Most of the themes you need are built into the main `ggplot2` package.

If you want more themes, check out:
  - the `ggthemes` package
  - the `ggthemer` package
  - My fav: to make plots in the style of XKCD comics, see [.url[here]](https://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/)
  
We will stick to the basic themes just so you can get a sense of things.

# Side Note

Before we get going, let's create the same `age_category` variable that we made in the [09: Stats & Plot Practice](/practice/09-practice)

# The Nitty Gritty of Themes
What if you like a theme, but you still want to make changes? For example, you like the *black & white* theme, but you still want to:
  - get rid of major grid lines
  - remove the title from your legend
  - center the title
  - make a black box around your legend, and fill it with the color gray

--

To do this, you first define your theme, then add another `theme()` layer that includes arguments with your specific changes. You pick an argument you want to change, set it equal to one of the following 4 options, and finally put your changes inside one of these 4 options. You can think of these as "wrappers":
  - `element_text`
  - `element_rect`
  - `element_line`
  - `element_blank`

This gives us an **overwhelming** amount of flexibility. **GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!**

# Manually Changing Things

As you can tell, there are __*many*__ ways to change aspects of `ggplot2` plots. Next up is a selection of changes that are fairly common. To find the exact values for something, use Google!
  - "change shapes in ggplot2" -- good search
  - "shapes plot R" -- bad search 

The random assortment:
  - Manually set the shape of points in a scatterplot
  - Manually set the color/fill
  - Grayscale
  - Changing the location, title, and labels of the Legend
  - Change scale of plot axes
  - Change angle of text labels

The title of your legend will be the name of your variable. If you have something like `age_category`, that doesn't look as nice as a formatted title. You *can* change the variable name within your dataset. But that can often have unintended consequences.

# Axis labels
Sometimes, you can get really cramped axis labels. There are different ways to deal with this. 

2 key things to know is that you can adjust vertically and horizontally:
  - `hjust` = horizontal justification. 0 = left-justified, 1 = right-justified, .5 = center-justified
  - `vjust` = vertical justification. 0 = bottom, 1 = top, .5 = center

BUT, if you change the angle on something, the horizontal/vertical thing gets really confusing. Just try both until you get what you want.

If you stare closely, you'll notice that the names don't line up with the tic marks! Even though this would normally be a horizontal alignment, you changed the angle of the text to 90...so we use the vertical alignment instead!

What if we want the last letter of every label to be right up against the tic mark? Normally, this would be vertical alignment. But since we're flipped, it's not horizontal alignment.
