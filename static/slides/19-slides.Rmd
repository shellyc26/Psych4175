# Bar Plots & Error Bars
- Usually bar plots reflect the *mean* of a group (or at least some summary statistic)
- Just like vertical/horizontal lines, we'll need to transform our raw data into summary statistics
- If you decide to work with summary stats, you have a few options:

  - You can calculate the summaries within the `ggplot` code
  
  - Calculate the summaries as their own data.frame, then call it from inside the `ggplot` function

--

  - I personally suggest the latter
  
---

# Bar Plots & Error Bars
- When it comes to error bars, you need to decide what your bars will reflect and calculate the appropriate statistic!

  - 1 standard deviation
  
  - 95% confidence intervals
  
  - 1 standard error of the mean
  
--

- For now, we'll stick to +/- 1 standard deviation

---
# Bar Plots & Error Bars

Step 1: Summarize your data

```{r}
summaryStats <- midus %>%
  group_by(age_category, sex) %>%
  summarize(means = mean(physical_health_self),
            sds = sd(physical_health_self)) %>%
  mutate(sdLower = means - sds) %>%
  mutate(sdUpper = means + sds)

summaryStats
```

# Jittering

The way we can get around this is with **jittering**

  - A **jitter** is a slight irregular movement, variance, or unsteadiness
  - Someone is jittery means someone is *shaky*, usually with nervousness

--

We can **jitter** the points on the x-axis to randomly shift them. This let's us see *all* of the points.

  - We are adding in some random variance to make things more visible.

# Layers on Layers on Layers
- By now you've hopefully realized that you can add as many layers as you'd like to your `ggplot`
- This means you can use multiple shapes or `geom_`s from the same data on the same plot
- Be careful!
  - You are layering `geom`s *on top* of each other
  - Order matters depending on what you're doing!

# Last Remaining Thoughts

- Idea of "addition" & "piping"
- Exporting plots
- Debugging
- Fun!

---

# Idea of "addition"
- When you use the `+` at the end of a line, you are literally telling `R` that you want to *add* something -- you're saying *"add another layer to the plot"*
- As a result, you will see a lot of code, especially in the help documentation, that looks like this:

.code-small[
```{r, out.width='40%'}
p <- ggplot(data = midus)
p <- p + geom_point(aes(x = age, y = BMI, color = age_category))
p <- p + labs(title = "Plotting by Addition")
p
```
]
---

# Idea of "piping"
- You can also "pipe" `ggplot2` code into `tidyverse` code
- Notice that the pipe `%>%` changes into a `+` when you entire `ggplot2` code!

.code-small[
```{r, out.width='40%'}
midus %>%
  filter(age_category != "old") %>% 
  group_by(age_category) %>% 
  summarize(meanHostility = mean(hostility)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = age_category, y = meanHostility)) + #<<
  geom_col(aes(fill = age_category))
```
]
---

# Exporting
- So you've made a plot. Yay! Now you need to get it out of `R` and into a file format you can upload (.png, .tiff, .jpf, .pdf etc.)

- Method 1: `ggsave()` function
  - It should work most of the time
  - Simplier, easier
  - Not as much control

- Method 2: Turn on/off the graphic device
  - Better if you need something specific
  - Specific resolution, compression etc.
  - Slightly more annoying, but not by much

# Debugging
If your code isn't working, and you really think that it should, you might be using a function that comes from a different package.
  - Ex: `alpha` exists in both the `ggplot2` and `psych` packages
  - If it gives you trouble, just specify the package like this `ggplot2::alpha`

--

If you still want to cry `r emo::ji("cry")` because your plot still isn't giving you what you want, try:
  - Store the plot as an object
  - Then look at its inner workings using `ggplot_build(plotObject)` where `plotObject` is the name of your plot

--

Finally, when looking around the internet for help, make sure that the version number is kind of close to the one you're working with (usually doesn't need to be exact). The `tidyverse` including `ggplot2` has been around for some time now, and they have gone through many iterations over the years.

# Fun!

This code makes the little stick figure dude. You choose the angles of each line. You can use $\pi$ charts!

```{r}
dataman <- data.frame(x= 1.75, y=-.4,   # specific for xkcd
                      scale = .5,
                      ratioxy = 1,
                      angleofspine =  -pi/2  ,
                      anglerighthumerus = c((7*pi)/4),
                      anglelefthumerus = c((5*pi)/4), # use the charts!!
                      anglerightradius = c(pi/6),
                      angleleftradius = c((5*pi)/6),
                      angleleftleg = 3*pi/2  + pi / 12 ,
                      anglerightleg = 3*pi/2  - pi / 12,
                      angleofneck = runif(1, 3*pi/2-pi/10, 3*pi/2+pi/10))

```

# Fun!
Finally, something you know -- `ggplot`!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = vacc, y = autism, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  xkcdaxis(xrange, yrange) +
  xkcdman(mapping, dataman) +
  annotate("text", x=0, y = -1.75,
           label = "The relationship between vaccines
           and autism is as flat as the earth",
           family="Humor Sans", size = 3) +
  labs(y = "Autism",
       x = "Vaccines",
       title = "Which conspiracy theory\nshould you believe??") +
  theme_xkcd() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Humor Sans", size = 11))
```

# Fun!
And here's the actual plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = vacc, y = autism, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  xkcdaxis(xrange, yrange) +
  xkcdman(mapping, dataman) +
  annotate("text", x=0, y = -1.75,
           label = "The relationship between vaccines
           and autism is as flat as the earth",
           family="Humor Sans", size = 3) +
  labs(y = "Autism",
       x = "Vaccines",
       title = "Which conspiracy theory\nshould you believe??") +
  theme_xkcd() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Humor Sans", size = 11))
```
