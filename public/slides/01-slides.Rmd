# Plan for today

- Why R? 
- Getting oriented with R & RStudio
- Random helpful tidbits to know before you get going

# Why R?
- It's FREE!
- It's open source
- It's excellent at statistics and data visualization
- It's flexible
- And also, it's **free**

# Getting Familiar with RStudio

---

# RStudio

- Open RStudio in a new window on your computer
- Watch this Video & play with RStudio in parallel

---

# Running Code
Step 1:

- If you want to run **one line**, click anywhere in that line of code so that your cursor is there
- If you want to run **multiple lines**, highlight all of the lines of code you want to run

Step 2:

- Click "Run" at top right of script
- Hit `command` + `return` (for Mac) or `ctrl` + `enter` (for PC)

---

# Comment. Your. Code.

# **`#`**
- You can use the hashtag/pound symbol to add comments/notes to yourself -- **R knows that this is a note**

- It is *strongly* recommended that you make notes to yourself along the way!
