# Basic Statistics &amp; Plotting

Hopefully you're feeling more comfortable with some of terminology used in programming:

- Data.frames

##### Statistics

All statistics are computed with functions.

If you know the type of analysis you want to run, find the corresponding function and go for it!

.pull-right[
##### Plotting

All plots are made with functions. 

Slightly different is that one particular package is *a lot* better at plotting than `base` R.

# About the MIDUS dataset

Variables available in this data file:
  - **Demographic variables**: age, sex
  - **Physical health variables**: self-rated physical health, heart problems, father had heart attack, BMI
  - **Mental health variables**: self-rated meantal health, self-esteem, life satisfaction *(life overall, work, health, relationship with spouse/partner, relationship with children)*, hostility *(stress reactivity &amp; agression*)

--

Please load in `midus`, make sure:
- Make sure the variables `sex`, `heart_self`, and `heart_father` are `factor()` variables (rather than characters)
- Use the same `na.omit()` function to remove all `NA` values 
---

# Before we begin...
- Check to make sure you have the `ggplot2` package *installed*

- Check to make sure the `ggplot2` package is *loaded*

- If "no" to either, how can you solve this?

# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:



```r
ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) + 
  geom_something(things that impact just the something)
```

---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:



```r
*ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) +
  geom_something(things that impact just the something)
```


Things like:
- data.frame used for plotting
- defining your x &amp; y axes


---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:



```r
ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) + 
* geom_something(things that impact just the something)
```


`geom_` typically means **shape**. What shapes do you want to use to represent your data in the plot?
- `geom_histogram` -- histogram
- `geom_density` -- distributions
- `geom_violin` -- distributions
- `geom_point` -- scatter plot
- `geom_col` -- bar plot


---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

The functions `ggplot()` and `geom_()` can take on different **aesthetics** as an argument, using `aes()`. 

**Aesthetics** are how you control what you want your plot to look like; how can you make it pretty? Examples:
- Which variables are the `x-` and `y-` axes?
- `color` (should you color the plot by some variable?)
- `fill` (very similar to `color`, should you fill the plot in somehow; used for bar graphs and boxplots)
- `shape` (do you want groups to have different shaped points?)
- `size` (how big should plotted data be?)

.small[*Note: person that made this package is from New Zealand; the British spellings and American spellings work! Although using tab-complete my auto-fill the British spellings*]

---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`
- Usually `aes()` contains some information that comes directly from the **data**
- If the information is *not* based on the data, it does not need to be inside an `aes()` argument. 


```r
ggplot(data = midus, aes(x = age, y = BMI)) +
* geom_point()
```

# Exercise 1
Make a scatter plot of `self_esteem` (x-axis) against `life_satisfaction` (y-axis)

Make the points of the scatter plot a different `shape` based on the `sex` variable (for example, males might be circles and females might be squares)

Make the `color` of the points different based on `sex`

Set the `size` of all points equal to `3`

We're going to practice plotting with `ggplot2` while learning some really basic statistical tests.

# A note about formulas
You can read the `~` (tilda) as "by" or "predicted by"

`hostility ~ sex` means...
  - "hostility by sex"
  - "is hostility predicted by sex?"

BONUS:
- Look at the help page for `t.test()`. How do you run a one-tailed t-test? Run it! Does your answer change?
- How could you `fill` the boxplots so that males and females are shown in different colors? 
- Look at the help page for `labs()` and see if you can give your plot a title and different x- &amp; y-axes labels.

# ANOVA
Say you wanted to dichotomize your `self_esteem` variable into those with **high self-esteem** (above the mean) and those with **low self-esteem** (below the mean). 

You want to see if `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variables predict `BMI`.

Bar plots suck. Height of each bar should reflect that group's **mean**. So we first need to calculate the means, and store them in a data.frame. 


```r
femaleHigh &lt;- subset(midus, sex == "Female" &amp; self_esteem_di == "high")
femaleHighMean &lt;- mean(femaleHigh$BMI)

femaleLow &lt;- subset(midus, sex == "Female" &amp; self_esteem_di == "low")
femaleLowMean &lt;- mean(femaleLow$BMI)

maleHigh &lt;- subset(midus, sex == "Male" &amp; self_esteem_di == "high")
maleHighMean &lt;- mean(maleHigh$BMI)

maleLow &lt;- subset(midus, sex == "Male" &amp; self_esteem_di == "low")
maleLowMean &lt;- mean(maleLow$BMI)

meansData &lt;- data.frame(sex = c("Female", "Female", "Male", "Male"),
                        self_esteem_di = c("high", "low", "high", "low"),
                        meanBMI = c(femaleHighMean,
                                    femaleLowMean,
                                    maleHighMean,
                                    maleLowMean))
```
---
# ANOVA
**Does `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variable predict `BMI`?** 

Then we can plot, using our **NEW** data.frame .small[*(Note: we will cover a __MUCH__ easier way of doing this when we talk about `tidyverse` in the next section)*]

```r

# You try!

Below is some code that trichotomizes `age` into the following groups:
- 28-40 -- "young"
- 40-60 -- "middle"
- 60-84 -- "old"

Copy (&amp; run) the following code into your script so you can do the next exercise:

```r
midus$age_category &lt;- cut(x = midus$age,
                          breaks = c(28, 40, 60, 84),
                          labels = c("young", "middle", "old"),
                          include.lowest = TRUE)
```

**NOW**, is there a main effect of `age_category`, a main effect of `heart_self`, and is there a `age_category x heart_self` interaction on `BMI`?

# Things to note about regression
- Assign your `lm()` object to your global environment. You can get coefficients, predicted values etc.

--

- If you want the relationship betwen X1 and Y, *after controlling for* X2, you can make a scatter plot with the model's **fitted* values. 

--

- If you want to view the output table of a regression, use `summary()` (just like we did with ANOVA).

--

- If you want the `\(R^2\)`, `\(F\)`-statistic etc., assign the `summary(model)` object to your global environment.

--

- Check out the `broom` package to format your regression outputs into a nice data.frame.
