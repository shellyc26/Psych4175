# About the MIDUS dataset

Variables available in this data file:
  - **Demographic variables**: age, sex
  - **Physical health variables**: self-rated physical health, heart problems, father had heart attack, BMI
  - **Mental health variables**: self-rated meantal health, self-esteem, life satisfaction *(life overall, work, health, relationship with spouse/partner, relationship with children)*, hostility *(stress reactivity & agression*)

--

Please load in `midus`, make sure:
- Make sure the variables `sex`, `heart_self`, and `heart_father` are `factor()` variables (rather than characters)
- Use the same `na.omit()` function to remove all `NA` values 
---

# Before we begin...
- Check to make sure you have the `ggplot2` package *installed*

- Check to make sure the `ggplot2` package is *loaded*

- If "no" to either, how can you solve this?

# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) + 
  geom_something(things that impact just the something)
```

---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) + #<<
  geom_something(things that impact just the something)
```


Things like:
- data.frame used for plotting
- defining your x & y axes


---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has the following structure:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(things that impact the entire plot) + 
  geom_something(things that impact just the something) #<<
```


`geom_` typically means **shape**. What shapes do you want to use to represent your data in the plot?
- `geom_histogram` -- histogram
- `geom_density` -- distributions
- `geom_violin` -- distributions
- `geom_point` -- scatter plot
- `geom_col` -- bar plot


---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`

The functions `ggplot()` and `geom_()` can take on different **aesthetics** as an argument, using `aes()`. 

**Aesthetics** are how you control what you want your plot to look like; how can you make it pretty? Examples:
- Which variables are the `x-` and `y-` axes?
- `color` (should you color the plot by some variable?)
- `fill` (very similar to `color`, should you fill the plot in somehow; used for bar graphs and boxplots)
- `shape` (do you want groups to have different shaped points?)
- `size` (how big should plotted data be?)

.small[*Note: person that made this package is from New Zealand; the British spellings and American spellings work! Although using tab-complete my auto-fill the British spellings*]

---
# Plotting with `ggplot2`
- Usually `aes()` contains some information that comes directly from the **data**
- If the information is *not* based on the data, it does not need to be inside an `aes()` argument. 

```{r, out.height='40%', out.width='40%'}
ggplot(data = midus, aes(x = age, y = BMI)) +
  geom_point() #<<
```

# Exercise 1
Make a scatter plot of `self_esteem` (x-axis) against `life_satisfaction` (y-axis)

Make the points of the scatter plot a different `shape` based on the `sex` variable (for example, males might be circles and females might be squares)

Make the `color` of the points different based on `sex`

Set the `size` of all points equal to `3`

**Is there a difference in `hostility` between men and women in the `midus` sample?**

---
# A note about formulas
You can read the `~` (tilda) as "by" or "predicted by"

`hostility ~ sex` means...
  - "hostility by sex"
  - "is hostility predicted by sex?"

BONUS:
- Look at the help page for `t.test()`. How do you run a one-tailed t-test? Run it! Does your answer change?
- How could you `fill` the boxplots so that males and females are shown in different colors? 
- Look at the help page for `labs()` and see if you can give your plot a title and different x- & y-axes labels.

# ANOVA
Say you wanted to dichotomize your `self_esteem` variable into those with **high self-esteem** (above the mean) and those with **low self-esteem** (below the mean). 

You want to see if `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variables predict `BMI`.

# Dichotomizing variables
**As a general rule, don't do this**

.small[BUT, it does make for a nice teaching example `r emo::ji("smiley")`]

```{r}
# create the groups; store as a new variable
midus$self_esteem_di <- ifelse(test =
                                 midus$self_esteem > mean(midus$self_esteem),
                               yes = "high",
                               no = "low")

# make sure the new variable is treated as a factor
midus$self_esteem_di <- factor(midus$self_esteem_di)

# for us to view it
head(midus[,c(1,2,3,12)])
```
---
# ANOVA
**Does `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variable predict `BMI`?** (no interaction)


```{r}
anova1 <- aov(BMI ~ sex + self_esteem_di, data = midus)
summary(anova1)
```

---

# ANOVA
**Does `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variable predict `BMI`?** (**WITH** interaction)

summary(anova2)
```
---
# ANOVA
**Does `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variable predict `BMI`?** 

Bar plots suck. Height of each bar should reflect that group's **mean**. So we first need to calculate the means, and store them in a data.frame. 

```{r}
femaleHigh <- subset(midus, sex == "Female" & self_esteem_di == "high")
femaleHighMean <- mean(femaleHigh$BMI)

femaleLow <- subset(midus, sex == "Female" & self_esteem_di == "low")
femaleLowMean <- mean(femaleLow$BMI)

maleHigh <- subset(midus, sex == "Male" & self_esteem_di == "high")
maleHighMean <- mean(maleHigh$BMI)

maleLow <- subset(midus, sex == "Male" & self_esteem_di == "low")
maleLowMean <- mean(maleLow$BMI)

meansData <- data.frame(sex = c("Female", "Female", "Male", "Male"),
                        self_esteem_di = c("high", "low", "high", "low"),
                        meanBMI = c(femaleHighMean,
                                    femaleLowMean,
                                    maleHighMean,
                                    maleLowMean))

```
---
# ANOVA
**Does `sex` and your newly dichotomized `self_esteem` variable predict `BMI`?** 

Then we can plot, using our **NEW** data.frame .small[*(Note: we will cover a __MUCH__ easier way of doing this when we talk about `tidyverse` in the next section)*]
```{r, out.height='40%', out.width='40%'}

  geom_col(aes(fill = self_esteem_di), position = "dodge")

# You try!

Below is some code that trichotomizes `age` into the following groups:
- 28-40 -- "young"
- 40-60 -- "middle"
- 60-84 -- "old"

Copy (& run) the following code into your script so you can do the next exercise:
```{r}
midus$age_category <- cut(x = midus$age,
                          breaks = c(28, 40, 60, 84),
                          labels = c("young", "middle", "old"),
                          include.lowest = TRUE)
```

**NOW**, is there a main effect of `age_category`, a main effect of `heart_self`, and is there a `age_category x heart_self` interaction on `BMI`?

youngNoHeartMean <- mean(youngNoHeart$BMI)

middleYesHeart <- subset(midus, age_category == "" & heart_self == "Yes")
middleYesHeartMean <- mean()

middleNoHeart <- subset(midus, age_category == "" & heart_self == "No")
middleNoHeartMean <- mean(BMI)

oldYesHeart <- subset(midus, age_category == "" & heart_self == "")
oldYesHeartMean <- mean()

oldNoHeart <- subset(midus, age_category == "" & heart_self == "")
oldNoHeartMean <- mean()
```
---
# Data prep for bar plot

Now that you've filled in (& run!) the previous code, turn all of that into a data.frame you can use. .small[*(remember, we're going to cover a __MUCH__ easier way of doing this when we talk about `tidyverse`)*]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
meansData <- data.frame(age_category = c("young", "young", "middle", "middle",
                                         "old", "old"),
                        heart_self = c("Yes", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No"),
                        meanBMI = c(youngYesHeartMean,
                                    youngNoHeartMean,
                                    middleYesHeartMean,
                                    middleNoHeartMean,
                                    oldYesHeartMean,

# Things to note about regression
- Assign your `lm()` object to your global environment. You can get coefficients, predicted values etc.

--

- If you want the relationship betwen X1 and Y, *after controlling for* X2, you can make a scatter plot with the model's **fitted* values. 

--

- If you want to view the output table of a regression, use `summary()` (just like we did with ANOVA).

--

- If you want the $R^2$, $F$-statistic etc., assign the `summary(model)` object to your global environment.

--

- Check out the `broom` package to format your regression outputs into a nice data.frame.
