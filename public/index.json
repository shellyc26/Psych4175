You have already practiced a bit in the Practice sets. But the more you engage with R, the better you’ll get.\nThe assignments in this section are meant to give you even more practice. To earn full credit, you must complete all aspects of the assignment. That includes things like typing out any sentences if I ask you to explain something.\nAssignment Instructions Submitting You should complete the assignments on your local computer. You will upload code directly to our Canvas site to be graded. If you use a dataset that is different from the ones I’ve provided, then you must also submit that dataset (see below).\n Dataset In a perfect world, you would use your own research dataset. However, in order for you to practice all the different elements we cover in the lectures, your dataset should have the following characteristics:\n It should be in either a .csv or .txt file format. This is typical of most datasets. If it is not in either of these formats, and you don’t know how to convert it, please email me ASAP. It should contain rows and columns:  There must be at least 20 observations (rows). If you have a very long dataset (several hundred or thousands of rows), you may shorten it for the purposes of these assignments.  Ideally, the columns would be objects of different classes. Most importantly however is that there are at least 3 columns that would be considered numeric or integer. There should also be 1 or 2 columns that are characters. Of these, I would like at least 1 column to be a categorical variable. This must be de-identified! It is fine for coded IDs to be included (e.g., SubjectID etc.). However, please no identifying information. This includes names, family structures, zip codes and more. If your dataset has any of these items and you don’t know how to get rid of them, please email me ASAP!  If you want to use a dataset but are unsure if it meets these qualifications, please email me ASAP and we can work through it.\nThe struggle is real when it comes to code.

You want to make sure things look the way they ought to look, and that you (and whoever is reading your code) knows what is happening.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n In 1-2 sentences, describe your dataset. No need for a ton of detail, just generally, what’s in it.\n Using code, find the object class of each column vector. Then find the object class of the entire data set. Describe if these make sense, or are there any that were unexpected? If they were unexpected, why?\n Check out your variables that are text strings or characters. Do you want them to remain this way, or do you want to convert them into categorical variables, called factors? If they should be treated as categorical variables, please do so using the factor() function.\n   Here’s a HINT for the last item:\n new_column \u0026lt;- factor(data$column) makes a completely new object outside of the dataset. data$new_column \u0026lt;- factor(data$column) makes a new column that lives within the existing dataset. data$column \u0026lt;- factor(data$column) overwrites the original column.   Results: Summary Statistics – Part 1 One of the first items in the “Results” section of an academic paper is to look at summary statistics of the variables of interest. Here’s your shot!\nHere’s your to-do list:\n For 2 of your numeric/integer variables, get the mean, standard deviation, and range. If you don’t know the function names, Google it!\n For your categorical variable, get very quick counts of each level (e.g., how many observations are there in group 1 vs. group 2).\n   Here are some HINTS:\n In your functions, pay attention to missing data! The easiest function to use for your second to-do item was shown in the slides under “commonly used functions”.   Results: Summary Statistics – Part 2 Another thing we check in the Results section of a paper is whether our variables of interest might differ based on something we don’t want. For example, if all of our male participants were notably older than all of our female participants, it might screw up the interpretation of our results.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Make a smaller datasets that only contain items from each level of your categorical variable. For example, let’s say the factor “treatment_group” had 2 levels: treatment and control. Make a new data.frame that is something like data_treatment and another new data.frame that is data_controls. Do this via INDEXING and LOGICAL OPERATORS.\n One thing you might notice is that when you make your new mini data.frames, if you look at the factor variable, it still has the original number of levels from the bigger data.frame – even though the other levels are not in there. Overwrite that variable to be a factor again (same thing as in the Data Cleaning section above). After you should have only 1 level (ex: all treatment or all controls).\n Now repeat the same summary statistics from above (for the numeric/integers only) but on each of your new mini data.frames. Do these numbers seem dramatically different or are they similar? What does that mean for your analysis?\n   Here is a HINT:\n Logical operators result in TRUE or FALSE. You can use this within indexing so that anything that evaluates to TRUE will be either the rows or the columns that are kept.   Congrats, you’ve finished!

The syntax for for loops looks like the following:\nfor (i in 1:some_number) { do something } The 1:some number portion refers to the elements you’re iterating over. If you wanted to do something 5 times, you could say 1:5.\nFYI: You can iterate over lots of things! This includes things like:\n vectors rows of a data.frame columns of a data.frame lists   The i stands for “each”. So the first line in the example code above reads as: For each item in 1 through some number…\nLastly, the section between the curly brackets {} is the body of the for loop. This area includes all of the commands that will be executed with every iteration of the loop.\nQuick Quiz\n  Most of the time, we want to store the outcome of whatever commands occur during the body of the for loop. In order to do this, we have to initialize an object.\nQuick Quiz\n Drew made the following for loop with the goal of squaring all of the numbers between 1 and 5, and then printing them as a single vector (1 4 9 16 25) to the console. She made a mistake though.\nmy_object \u0026lt;- NULL for (i in 1:5) { my_object \u0026lt;- i^2 } print(my_object)  You try!\n     Introducing if/else statements In programming languages, if/else statements are used for conditional situations. If a given boolean statement is evaluated to TRUE, then one block of code will be executed, if instead (“else”) the boolean statements evaluates to FALSE, then a different block of code will be executed.\nBelow is the general format for if/else statements:\nif(boolean statement) { # code to be executed if boolean is true } else { # code to be executed if boolean is false } What situations will you need to use if/else statements for?\nIf/else is useful for recoding and sorting data based on conditional rules. If/else statements also combine with for loops for very useful coding. Take the following example: Ten students were asked how much they like or dislike provel cheese on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 = love it). However, we want to change this numeric scale to label all values below or equal to 5 as “dislike” and above or equal to 6 “like”.\n# Student ratings (numeric) provel_cheese_rating \u0026lt;- c(1, 1, 9, 3, 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 10) # Initialize like vs. dislike vector like_dislike \u0026lt;- c() for(i in provel_cheese_rating) { if(i \u0026lt;= 5) { like_dislike \u0026lt;- append(like_dislike, \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot;) } else { like_dislike \u0026lt;- append(like_dislike, \u0026quot;like\u0026quot;) } } # View outcome print(like_dislike) ## [1] \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; ## [8] \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;dislike\u0026quot; \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; Using a combination of a for loop and an if/else statement, we were able to recode the vector. Now we know where the students stand on the provel issue…\n  FYI: There is an additional feature of if/else statements called else if. This feature can be used for more complex conditional situations\n What if a simple binary conditional statement won’t cut it? For example, maybe we want to entirely change a series of character labels. Here, we can use elseif to specify all possibilities.\n(Note that, realistically, we would probably never write out every name of animal like this. Maybe instead we would reference a database and search for items, and then label their class, etc.)\n# Animals animals \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;dog\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;iguana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;frog\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cardinal\u0026quot;) # Initialize classes of animals vector animals_class \u0026lt;- c() for(i in animals) { if(i == \u0026quot;dog\u0026quot;) { animals_class \u0026lt;- append(animals_class, \u0026quot;mammal\u0026quot;) } else if(i == \u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;) { animals_class \u0026lt;- append(animals_class, \u0026quot;mammal\u0026quot;) } else if(i == \u0026quot;iguana\u0026quot;) { animals_class \u0026lt;- append(animals_class, \u0026quot;reptile\u0026quot;) } else if(i == \u0026quot;frog\u0026quot;) { animals_class \u0026lt;- append(animals_class, \u0026quot;amphibian\u0026quot;) } else { animals_class \u0026lt;- append(animals_class, \u0026quot;bird\u0026quot;) } } # View outcome print(animals_class) ## [1] \u0026quot;mammal\u0026quot; \u0026quot;mammal\u0026quot; \u0026quot;reptile\u0026quot; \u0026quot;amphibian\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bird\u0026quot; FYI: R has a built in function called ifelse(). It does the same thing as an if/else statement. However, it only has 2 conditions. That is, it does not have the opportunity to use else if for multiple conditional statements.\nI have unfortunately seen people nest ifelse() statements. This is incredibly bad form! If you have to do this, it is worth your time to write out a full if/else if/else statement!\n You try!\nLet’s expand our provel example. Write an if/else if/else statement that says:\n Scores of 1-3 correspond to “dislike” Scores of 4-6 correspond to “neutral” Scores of 7-10 correspond to “like”       Using for loops for bootstrapping Now we will use for loops in order to bootstrap our data.\nAs a reminder:\n In statistics, bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement Examples:  bootstrapped means (from random samples of a population) bootstrapped confidence intervals   We are going to use bootstrapping to create our own sampling distribution of the mean, and compare the outcomes after a small number of iterations versus a large number of iterations.\n  Unfortunately not those kinds of samples…\nReminder: In statistics, the sampling distribution of the mean is a probability distribution of means drawn from numerous samples of the population.\n For this example, I have generated a population of data. The data.frame is called pop_data. It has a single column called PopulationMeans. The true population mean of this dataset is 100.1528973.\nHere is a histogram of the population data:\nggplot(pop_data, aes(x = PopulationMeans)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Population distribution\u0026quot;) It’s so great that here we have a population distribution. But in reality, we almost never have the population data. We only have sample data. Let’s randomly choose 30 people from the same population as above (not with replacement…30 unique individuals) and call it our sample. This is equivalent to saying “Our study had a n=30 where participants were college students at Wash U enrolled in Psych 101”. It’s not the entire population – it’s a sample of the population.\nsample_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(SampleMeans = sample(pop_data$PopulationMeans, size = 30, replace = FALSE)) ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = SampleMeans)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;, binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Sample distribution\u0026quot;) Let’s recap. We have a population distribution, and we randomly chose 30 people in our study. But the vast majority of the time, we don’t have the population distribution to work with. We only have the sample. In traditional NHST procedures, we use formulas and equations to estimate the true underlying sampling distribution of a statistic (like the mean). But when we are bootstrapping, there is no need to estimate – we actually go ahead and build the sampling distribution.\nWhen building the sampling distribution, you have to choose how many times/iterations you want to do this. Larger is better (like running more studies as opposed to fewer studies). Let’s illustrate this.\nThe mean of the true population (the one we almost never have access to) is 100 The mean of our sample of 30 participants (the one we always have access to; equivalent to running a study) is 97.1142558\nWe want to bootstrap the mean of our 30 participants to get as close as possible to the true population mean. We’re building up a sampling distribution. We can do this with a for loop where we pull from our sample many times, with replacement. But how many times? For this first attempt, let’s do a small number of samples (10) to create sample_means_small.\n# Initialize vector for means sample_means_small \u0026lt;- NULL # Use for loop to gather means of each sample for (i in 1:10) { indices \u0026lt;- sample(x = 1:30, size = 30, replace = T) subsample \u0026lt;- sample_data[indices,1] sample_means_small[i] \u0026lt;- mean(subsample) } Next, we will draw a slightly larger number of samples (50) to create sample_means_medium.\n# Initialize vector for means sample_means_medium \u0026lt;- NULL # Use for loop to gather means of each sample for (i in 1:100) { indices \u0026lt;- sample(x = 1:30, size = 30, replace = T) subsample \u0026lt;- sample_data[indices,1] sample_means_medium[i] \u0026lt;- mean(subsample) } To compare, we will do the same process with a larger set of random samples (1,000) to create sample_means_large.\n# Initialize vector for means sample_means_large \u0026lt;- NULL # Use for loop to gather means of each sample for (i in 1:1000) { indices \u0026lt;- sample(x = 1:30, size = 30, replace = T) subsample \u0026lt;- sample_data[indices,1] sample_means_large[i] \u0026lt;- mean(subsample) } Visualizing the three sampling distributions give us perspective as to how the number of iterations makes the sampling distribution approach normality.\nAdditionally, if we take the mean of the sampled means (in order to estimate the population mean), it will become more accurate as the size of the sampling distribution increases. In the plots below, the solid lines marks the true population mean, and the dashed lines mark the sampling distribution means.\nplot1 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = sample_means_small, aes(values), fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + xlab(\u0026quot;Sample means\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = small_m, linetype = \u0026quot;longdash\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = pop_m, color = \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(85, 115)) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Distribution of 10 samples\u0026quot;) plot2 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = sample_means_medium, aes(values), fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + xlab(\u0026quot;Sample means\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = medium_m, linetype = \u0026quot;longdash\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = pop_m, color = \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(85, 115)) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Distribution of 100 samples\u0026quot;) plot3 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = sample_means_large, aes(values), fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + xlab(\u0026quot;Sample means\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = large_m, linetype = \u0026quot;longdash\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = pop_m, color = \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(85, 115)) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Distribution of 1,000 samples\u0026quot;) ggarrange(plot1, plot2, plot3)  Using bootstrapping for confidence intervals Quick Quiz\n  OK based on the quiz above, we need to carry out our sampling procedure a large number of times. That’s exactly what we are doing with bootstrapping! So now all we need to do is get the upper and lower 2.5% quantiles and we have our confidence intervals. The real kicker is that you need to bootstrap your statistic, and then find the quantiles to align with your confidence intervals.\nYou try!\nNow we’re going to use bootstrapping to calculate the 95% confidence intervals for a 1-tailed t-test.

Results: Summary Statistics In the first assignment, I asked you to manually calculate some summary statistics. This next to-do list will show you a much simpler way of getting summary statistics.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Import your dataset. Make sure all the variables that should be factors are treated as such.\n Use the describe() function to get summary statistics of your numeric/integer columns only. You do not need to include things like participant ID in this – just the variables you might care about in an actual analysis.\n Modify one of it’s arguments so that it also shows the interquartile range. Do NOT calculate the interquartile range by hand.\n Now use describeBy() with one of your categorical variables. Write a comment telling me what changes?\n Finally, use the summary() function on the entire data.frame (keep it simple with summary(data)). Write a comment telling me if you prefer the describe/describeBy functions or the summary function? There is no right answer here. I just want to know your preference and why.\n    Results: Fun With Statistics Let’s have some good old fashioned nerdy fun with statistics.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Pick 2 of your numeric/integer variables (preferably 2 that you think might be related). Get the covariance of these variables using cov(). You may choose to store this as a new object or simply print it out to the console.\n Now take those same 2 variables, and get the z-scores of each variable. You may use the scale() function that we’ve previously used or you can do it in a different manner. Store these as a new data.frame. That is, you should end up with a data.frame that has 2 columns. Column 1 contains the z-scores of the first variable, and column 2 contains the z-scores of the second variable.\n Now get the covariance of your new data.frame. The one that has z-scores. Again, you may store this as a new object or simply print it out to the console.\n Finally, get the correlation of the two variables from the original data.frame (not the one with z-scores). Use the cor() function. Compare this correlation to the different covariances. Write a comment telling me what you notice? Do you remember your statistics class? 😉\n    Results: Plot Your Data Now for the crux of almost every academic paper! Plotting!\nHere’s your to-do list:\n You will be making plots using ggplot2 code. As long as you have loaded the tidyverse package, you should be able to run these easily. However, check to make sure that there is a check mark ✅ next to the ggplot2 package under the Packages tab. If it is unchecked, then please load it.\n Make a scatterplot of the 2 variables from your original data.frame. Make sure the points are not the color black. Specify a new color of your choice.\n Make a scatterplot of the 2 variables from your z-scored data.frame. Write a comment telling me the difference between this plot and the one you just made.\n Finally, make a scatter plot of the 2 original variables, make the colors AND the shapes based on one of your categorical variables.\n Add the following layer to your plot geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", aes(color = yourFactorVariable)) Write a comment telling me if there are different relationships for each category?     Results: Influence of Outliers Outliers can be a real pain in the butt for researchers. One challenge that researchers face is determining which observations are actually outliers to begin with. That is, are they real scores that we should consider? Or are they an artifact of something else? One common way of defining an outlier is to say let’s treat any score that is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean as an outlier. That’s what you’re going to do here, using the same 2 variables that you used above in your scatterplots (use the variables that are not z-scores).\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Make a new data.frame that contains all of your columns from the original, but remove the rows that contain outliers – as defined as being more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.\n Now I want you to remake the 3rd plot from above, but now using this new dataset where the outliers are removed. (Include the geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", aes(color = yourFactorVariable)) layer) Compare the two plots. Are the trends different now that you’ve removed the outliers?\n   Here are some HINTS on how to do this:\n Use multiple logical operators that are then nested within a function. You may choose to use indexing or you may choose to use a function instead (it’s one we covered in lectures). “Away from the mean” can be in two directions. That is, you can have outliers because values are too high or too low.  General Note On Outliers: I am not suggesting that this “2 standard deviations away from the mean” method is the correct way of defining an outlier. How you define outliers is completely dependent upon the data. Similarly, removing outliers is one option for handling them, but it is not the only option. How you want to handle outliers in your own research should be discussed with your colleagues before any statistical analyses are performed (and ideally before data collection begins).\n BOOM! It’s over!

Before we start creating our own functions, let’s review what functions are composed of:\n Function name: The name of the function, which is used to call the function after it is defined (for example, ‘head’ is the name of the head() function). Arguments: Arguments are placeholders. If arguments are a defined part of a function, then values (typically) must be assigned to them. Arguments can also have default values, in which case values may not need to be designated. Function body: The body of a function is a collection of statements that determine what the function does. Return value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated. It is whatever is output by the function.  The syntax for defining a function is as follows:\nfunction_name \u0026lt;- function(arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_x) { Function body return(your_output) } FYI: Functions technically don’t have to have defined arguments. However, in most cases arguments are helpful and/or necessary to make a function generalizable.\n For example, maybe we ran a study with 50 subjects, and subjects with odd number IDs were randomly assigned to Counterbalance A and subjects with even number IDs were randomly assigned to Counterbalance B. We forgot to include this information in our data.frame (called studyData), so now it needs to be added. There are 50 participants total (50 rows), and the first few rows look like this:\n## subject score ## 1 1 72.58587 ## 2 2 75.55486 ## 3 3 77.16888 ## 4 4 70.30860 ## 5 5 75.85825 ## 6 6 76.01211 Put simply: We want to create a function that determines whether numbers in a vector are even or odd. The simplest version of this function (below) requires no arguments, and will return TRUE for subjects with even numbers and FALSE for subjects with odd numbers.\n# Creating the even_odd function even_odd \u0026lt;- function() { return((studyData$subject %% 2) == 0) } # Using the even_odd function even_odd() ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [13] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [25] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [37] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [49] FALSE TRUE What are the components of this function?\n even_odd is the name No arguments are defined, thus the empty parentheses (studyData$subject %% 2) == 0 is the body of the function and is nested in… return is your return statement  Nothing runs if you only execute the first 3 lines! You need to then call your function if you want it to actually run.\nThis function may be useful to someone else who regularly needs to check whether their subject numbers are even or odd… but this seems unlikely. Importantly, the function assumes that the name of the data.frame will always be studyData, and that the name of the subject column will be subject. The reason for this assumption? Because studyData and subject are hard-coded into the body of the function!\nWouldn’t it be better if the user could supply their own vector of numbers to the function? We can improve this function by specifying an argument, which we will just call x for now.\n# Improving the even_odd function even_odd \u0026lt;- function(x) { return((x %% 2) == 0) } # Using the even_odd function for studyData even_odd(x = studyData$subject) ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [13] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [25] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [37] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ## [49] FALSE TRUE # OR, using the even_odd function for another vector of numbers my_numbers \u0026lt;- 103:109 even_odd(x = my_numbers) ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE How else can we improve upon the current function?\nPerhaps we want to return the strings \"counterbalanceA\" and \"counterbalanceB\", instead of TRUE and FALSE. Now, we need to incorporate a for loop and an if/else statement into the body of our function. (If you don’t remember the syntax for if/else statements, revisit the practice set for for loops!)\n# Improving the even_odd function even_odd \u0026lt;- function(x) { new_vector \u0026lt;- c() # initialize the vector for(i in x) { if((i %% 2) == 0){ new_vector \u0026lt;- append(new_vector, \u0026quot;counterbalanceA\u0026quot;) } else { new_vector \u0026lt;- append(new_vector, \u0026quot;counterbalanceB\u0026quot;) } } return(new_vector) } # Let\u0026#39;s try out our improved even_odd function, and we\u0026#39;ll store it as a NEW column called \u0026#39;counterbalance\u0026#39; to studyData studyData$counterbalance \u0026lt;- even_odd(x = studyData$subject) head(studyData) ## subject score counterbalance ## 1 1 72.58587 counterbalanceB ## 2 2 75.55486 counterbalanceA ## 3 3 77.16888 counterbalanceB ## 4 4 70.30860 counterbalanceA ## 5 5 75.85825 counterbalanceB ## 6 6 76.01211 counterbalanceA The new version of this function is much more generalizable. One additional improvement we could make is to add more arguments that allow the user to choose what the labels for even and odd numbers are. Additionally, we should make sure that our arguments are clearly named!\n# Improving the even_odd function (one more time!) even_odd \u0026lt;- function(vectorName, evenLabel, oddLabel) { new_vector \u0026lt;- c() # initialize the vector for(i in vectorName) { if((i %% 2) == 0){ new_vector \u0026lt;- append(new_vector, evenLabel) } else { new_vector \u0026lt;- append(new_vector, oddLabel) } } return(new_vector) } # Make new group column in studyData # For example, maybe subjects were randomly assigned to a \u0026quot;training\u0026quot; versus a \u0026quot;control\u0026quot; group studyData$group \u0026lt;- even_odd(vectorName = studyData$subject, evenLabel = \u0026quot;training\u0026quot;, oddLabel = \u0026quot;control\u0026quot;) # View data.frame head(studyData) ## subject score counterbalance group ## 1 1 72.58587 counterbalanceB control ## 2 2 75.55486 counterbalanceA training ## 3 3 77.16888 counterbalanceB control ## 4 4 70.30860 counterbalanceA training ## 5 5 75.85825 counterbalanceB control ## 6 6 76.01211 counterbalanceA training Quick Quiz\n  Z-scores   Now that you’re re-acquainted with the mechanics of functions, it’s time to start writing your own!\nYou try!\n Create a function that z-scores a vector of data. (If you don’t remember the z-score formula, look back at Week 7!) Your function should be named z_score Your function should take one argument called values  Note, you are making this from scratch – do not include the scale function!\n    FYI: You can use for loops when writing functions (like the even_odd function above), and you can also nest your custom functions within a for loop!\n You try!\nUse a for loop with your new z-scores function to z-score all of the (numeric) columns in the iris dataset!\n Iterate across columns, saving the z-scored columns to a new data.frame called iris_zscored. If a column does not contain numeric values (cough Species cough), then it should still be added to iris_zscored, but without using the z-score function.  Hint: You may want to nest an if/else statement within your for loop!\n Let’s remind ourselves of what the iris dataset looks like:\nhead(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Hint: check out is.numeric(). You put the object you want to check inside of the parentheses and it will give you a TRUE or FALSE. If you want to ask if it’s TRUE or FALSE, you put the == or != (depending on what you’re doing) outside of the parenthesis.\nEx: is.numeric(studyData$group) == TRUE is asking whether the group variable from studyData is a numeric object. The answer is no, so it returns FALSE because studyData$group is a character variable.\n  Making a ggplot theme   Now you’re going to create a custom ggplot2 theme and save it as a function. This theme can then be called as a layer in any future plots you make, how useful! This is especially nice if you are giving a presentation writing a paper, and you want all of your figures to have the exact same theme (remember our data visualization best practices?).\nLet’s start by building on the classic ggplot2 theme (theme_classic()) – this is my personal favorite! I like that the background is plain, but the default font size is too small for my poor eyes. 👓 Also, I want to have the font in my plots be “Georgia”.\nTo make theme_drew(), we create a function! In the body of the function I call theme_classic() and make the changes I desire (see help pages for default settings). Note: I typically wouldn’t use serif fonts for professional plots, but they’re nice to use in examples.\nFYI: I wanted to use a special font that comes from the extrafont package, so in my function I added a require() statement. This will force R to load the package, or alert the user if the package is not found. We also need to require ggplot2 since the theme_classic() function comes from there.\n # Changing theme_classic into theme_drew theme_drew \u0026lt;- function(){ require(ggplot2) require(extrafont) loadfonts(device = \u0026quot;postscript\u0026quot;, quiet = TRUE) theme_classic(base_size = 14, base_family = \u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot;) } # Below creates 2 plots -- one using the original `theme_classic()` and # the other using the new custom `theme_drew()`. Then we\u0026#39;ll combine them into # a single figure! plot1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(studyData, aes(x = score)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + ylim(c(0,6)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Classic theme\u0026quot;) plot2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(studyData, aes(x = score)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;) + theme_drew() + ylim(c(0,6)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Drew\u0026#39;s custom theme\u0026quot;) ggarrange(plot1, plot2) Other than the text settings, theme_drew() is just mimicking theme_classic() right now. To make larger changes, we would add the following syntax:\ntheme_drew \u0026lt;- function(){ theme_classic(base_size = 14, base_family = \u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot;) theme( # change stuff here ) } Shelly is also a big fan of the ggplot2 classic theme, but she wants the background of the plot to be transparent. On this website, it might still look white because the background is white. But when the background color is something different, she wants that to be that color. To do this, we can make changes to the classic theme, removing the inner plot background (panel.background = element_blank()) and the surrounding background (plot.background = element_blank()), both of which are usually white. Now her plot is “see through”, and the background of the plot will match the background of whatever the plot sits on top of. She also adjusts the font to be Times New Roman.\nHow would you know about element_blank() etc.? Professor Google! If you search for modify ggplot2 theme or something similar, a whole bunch of things should come up. If you search for R theme, you’ll have a lot more trouble.\n# Changing theme_classic into theme_drew theme_shelly \u0026lt;- function(){ theme_classic() theme( panel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;transparent\u0026quot;, color = NA), plot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;transparent\u0026quot;, color = NA), text = element_text(family = \u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;) ) } # Let\u0026#39;s give it a go: plot1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(studyData, aes(x = score)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + ylim(c(0,6)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Classic theme\u0026quot;) plot2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(studyData, aes(x = score)) + geom_histogram(color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;plum4\u0026quot;) + theme_shelly() + ylim(c(0,6)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Shelly\u0026#39;s custom theme\u0026quot;) ggarrange(plot1, plot2) This isn’t a FYI, but just to show that the background of the plot now looks different!\n   You try!\nCreate your own theme!\n Call it theme_new. Then make a plot that uses this new theme to see how it looks!  There is no right or wrong answer. No solution or hints. This is a free spirited exercise\n Tip: Try Googling custom ggplot2 themes! You’ll find a lot of inspiration.\n Nice job finishing this practice! We hope you have fun making custom functions built for you. Once you get the hang of things and are ready to take it a step further, you can put your custom functions into your very own custom R package!\nMassive shout out to the Sping 2021 AI Drew McLaughlin for creating this excellent Practice Set!\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"de97328844235114b89fd552f1bc22dc","permalink":"/practice/28-practice/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/practice/28-practice/","section":"practice","summary":"Writing Functions  Z-scores Making a ggplot theme    Writing Functions   By now we’re very familiar with how to use functions from base R and installed packages.","tags":null,"title":"Practice Set: Writing Custom Functions","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Directories  Organize your files/projects!  RProjects Importing Data   This time we’ll talk about several little things, but all relate to importing your own data files. Most of us are not creating data.frames from scratch every time. Instead, our data is collected elsewhere, and stored as a file that a colleague shares with you, you download from the internet, etc.\nDirectories Your computer is just a series of folders. Folders are also known as directories. R will only look and save things to your working directory. To find your current working directory, you can type getwd() in your console. To change your working directory to somewhere else, you can use setwd(\"/file/path/goes/here\").\nFun Fact: The ~ sign helps shorten some of the really long file paths. Try setwd(\"~/rest/of/file/path\"). It usually points to the User’s directory. For instance, on my computer, it is set to /Users/Coop.\nOrganize your files/projects! YOU NEED to have some sort of structure to your projects. Play around with what’s right for you. Generally speaking, a good idea is something like this:\n Project Name (top level directory)  Data (sub-directory of Project Name) Code (sub-directory) Results (sub-directory)   You can be even more organized and thorough, depending on your project. But those above are a good starting point. Here’s an example of the directory structure of one of my projects. I’ve changed the names to be meaningful here.\n Project Name  data  data from source 1 data from source 2 data from source 3  code  preprocessing code postprocessing code  results  figures  manuscripts   Again, things will change based on your specific projects. But keeping things organized and using directories to your advantage will help you in the long run!\nWARNING: You need to save your files to the cloud. Absolutely do not save anything of importance to a Desktop or any old place on your computer. Box, Dropbox, Github, Open Science Framework, or any internal tool your school/company uses is fine. Always assume that your computer could get stolen tomrorow. You would be devastated if all of your work was suddenly gone.\nOk, I’ll get off the soapbox now…\n   RProjects RProjects are a specific type of file. It’s not one that you edit directly, though. Instead, it contains metadata that is useful for keeping things organized. We are going to combine a RProject file along with a package called here so that we never have to type all of these file paths again! Hooray!\nYou try! Follow along with Shelly as we create an RProject for this class. Together, we are going to do the following steps:\n Create a top level directory on Box. Call it Psych4175 or something similar. Create sub-directories (folders) for assignments, data, notes, and slides Download all datasets from Canvas and put it in the data sub-directory Install the here package (only do once!) Follow along as we open our project. See what happens when the whole thing moves to a totally different folder.    Importing Data For a lot of us, our data will be stored as either .csv or .txt files. R can handle many types of files but we’ll just practice with .csv. (For more on importing other types, ask your old friend Google)\nYou can use the RStudio interface to import your file (see the slides for how to do this). But it’s a lot of steps for something so simple! Let’s do it the lazy way.\nTo read in a .csv The function for reading in a .csv file is read.csv() and the input is the file path.\n To read in a .txt The function for reading in a .txt file is read.delim() and the input is the file path.\n File Path What? Remember that long \"/Users/Coop/Box Sync/Class/Data\" line that was our file path? We would have to type that every single time. But now that we have an RProject that contains metadata, we don’t need to do anything special! Instead, here’s what we’ll do:\nlibrary(here) data \u0026lt;- read.csv(here(\u0026quot;data/some_data_file.csv\u0026quot;)) Quick Quiz\n Assume we have a project whose structure looks like this:\n Project Name  data  data from source 1 data from source 2 data from source 3  code  preprocessing code postprocessing code  results  figures  manuscripts    You try!

Scary text that is actually OK might look like:\n    Actual Assignment You MUST use either the nhanes_small_assignment3.csv or superheroData_assignment3.csv datasets! These have been modified specifically for this assignment. You can find both on Canvas.\nIntroduction: Script Prep Open a new script file and complete this assignment (the same way you’ve been doing for previous assignments).\nHere’s your to-do list:\n At the top of your script, read in your dataset, load in the tidyverse package Make a comment that confirms that the above test run thing worked.    Methods: Data Wrangling Let’s practice with data wrangling. Everyone’s data is different, so this might depend on what you’re working with.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Make a tidyverse code chunk that uses at least 3 tidyverse functions. Do whatever you think makes the most sense. All 3 of the functions should be within the SAME code chunk. That is, you should not have 3 separate chunks of code. It should be a cohesive code chunk (put differently, a paragraph of code).   Here’s a list of some of the common tidyverse functions that you might want to use:\n filter separate unite mutate select arrange rename recode any of the join functions (see cheatsheet for more)  (Technically, pivot_wider and pivot_longer fit the bill, also. But we’re going to use these in the last part of the assignment, so please do not use those functions in this section.)\n Results Let’s make a bar plot with error bars!\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Make a smaller data.frame that contains all the information you would need to make a bar graph (including information for error bars of +/- 1 standard deviation) for at least two of your categorical variables.\n Then, use the plotting code below and replace the missing values with your data so that you can actually make the bar graph!\n   Here’s a HINT:\n The hardest part of this is trying to imagine what it is that you need! You need a continuous variable that you can collapse into a value per level of each of your two categorical variables. Then you need to calculate everything needed for the error bars.  Here’s the plotting code that you can copy/replace your data with\nXXX-1: correct data.frame XXX-2: one of the two categorical variables XXX-3: the summarized continuous variable XXX-4: the second of the categorical variables XXX-5: the value of the lower edge of the error bar XXX-6: the value of the upper edge of the error bar ggplot(data = XXX-1, aes(x = XXX-2, y = XXX-3, fill = XXX-4)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = XXX-5, ymax = XXX-6), position = position_dodge(width=.9), width = .2)  Data Wrangling Part 2 It’s very common to receive data in the wrong format. Either it comes to you as “long” but you need it to be “wide” or vice versa.\nBoth datasets now include information about time point. We’re going to use this information to convert to the other format!\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Determine if your data are currently in wide or long format. Make a note of this in your script. Use the time information to go from wide to long or long to wide. Use pivot_wider or pivot_longer. Rather than printing out the ENTIRE data.frame, print out the first 15 rows and the relevant columns using indexing. Make a comment that describes what aspects of your data.frame become wide or long; that is, describe what it is you just performed.    Fantastic work!

Practice with Vectors   Visualizing Star Wars Now that you’re oriented to RStudio, it’s time to write and execute some code. The following uses a data set about Star Wars characters (yay!). This is the same dataset as the Objects lecture\nYou try:\nRead through the lines of code. You probably won’t understand anything, but that’s OK! Click “Run Code” Watch what happens!    Over the course of this basic training, we’ll cover all the elements in this code block that produced this graph. It’s 100% OK if it looks like complete gibberish to you right now!\n Practice with Objects  Objects allow you to store things (values, models, entire datasets etc.) They are the nouns of programming languages; they are typically what we are acting on We give an object a name; this is called assignment, and it takes the form of:  nameOfMyObject  objectToStore The thing on the LEFT is the name you want to give your object.\nThen the arrow; first \u0026lt; (less than sign), then - (hyphen/dash) with no space in between.\nThe thing you want to actually store for later goes on the RIGHT.\nYou try! Create an object called continents that stores the number 7\n Note:\n Make sure you hit “Run Code” before “Submit Answer” If you get a message that’s something like “Last value is invisible”, you can ignore it    Things to note: If you were to run this line of code from within RStudio, you would see the word continents in the Environment pane (upper right side). This is an easy way for you to glance over and see if your object is actually stored.\n Notice that nothing printed out when you ran the code above. That code simply says “store the number 7 in an object called continents”. No where does it say \"show me what is stored in the continents object. To do that, you simply need to type it out again, like this:\n  continents \u0026lt;- 7 continents ## [1] 7 ☝️ The second line prints out continents, so the number 7 appears.\nIn your research, most of the time, you don’t necessarily want to print out every object. But it’s very helpful for things like homework assignments or showing your collaborators an answer/value.\nQuick Quiz\n   The whole point of making an object is that you can do things with them! For example:\n# I have 5 chickens chickens \u0026lt;- 5 # I have 4 cows cows \u0026lt;- 4 # How many animals do I have in total? chickens + cows ## [1] 9 You can also update your objects!\n# I sold 3 chickens chickens \u0026lt;- chickens - 3 # I bought 8 cows cows \u0026lt;- cows + 8 # What is my new total number of animals? # Still the same line of code from before! chickens + cows ## [1] 14 In this scenario, we did an “overwrite” of our original chickens and cows objects. We could have stored those as new objects. Something like: chickens_new \u0026lt;- chickens - 3. You will need to decide whether it makes sense to overwrite an object or to create a new one. Base it on what you’re trying to accomplish.\nQuick Quiz\n    Practice with Vectors A vector is a group of objects that’s 1-dimensional:\n It can be a row, a column, or just stand alone To make a vector, you can combine or concatenate objects together using c() Each object (vector or otherwise) has a specific data class. this can be things like numeric, character, factors, logical etc.  Check out this table:\n  ID State Smoker Age    ID1 Missouri TRUE 20  ID2 Iowa FALSE 18  ID3 Missouri FALSE 32  ID4 Idaho TRUE 25  ID5 Maine FALSE 25    Here, each row can be considered it’s own vector, and each column can be considered it’s own vector.\nYou try:\nFirst, create 4 vectors for each of these columns. Make sure they contain the same exact values as what you see in this table! Assign each vector to the following corresponding name:   ids state smoker age  Then, check the class() of each of your newly created vectors.    Remember Star Wars? You’ve already made a factor! You turned species into a factor. The result is that in our graph, we have discrete categories for the different types of Star Wars characters!\nempire empire$species ggplot(data = empire, aes(x = mass, y = height)) +\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;geom_point(aes(size = mass,\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;color = species),\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;alpha = .5) +\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;labs(title = \"Star Wars Characters\",\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;subtitle = \"by size\",\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;x = \"Weight (kg)\",\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;y = \"Height (cm)\") +\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;scale_size(guide = \"none\")  You are a ⭐ Learning to code can be really intimidating.

By this point, you have learned a ton about R. In this assignment, I want you to make something that you might actually use in your real life. So you will be making your own summaries of the things you’ve learned in this course – it will basically your own cheatsheet or crib sheet. Something like this:\n  Requirements for the structure of the document Create a .Rmd file (either RNotebook or RMarkdown is fine). When you turn in the assignment, I want you to submit BOTH the .html file and the .Rmd file. You are free to choose the topics – it can be anything we’ve covered!\nHere’s your to-do list (e.g., your file must include the following):\n 4 large headers (at least) indicating the 4 topics you’ll go through\n There must be at least 3 subheaders. They must be notably smaller than the larger headers, indicating that these are subsections of the topic you’re covering.\n You must have some normal text with at least a sentence or two that describes the topic and/or gives notes to yourself. Within the normal text, there should be both bolded text and italicized text. You must also include at least 1 list somewhere in the document (this could be ordered with numbers/letters or unordered with bullet points)\n There must be at least one code chunk per section that shows examples of the topic with code (see the above picture). You must show the results of your code as well. For example, if the topic is indexing, and in your code chunk you use indexing to get a subset, you need to print out that object so that I can see the output of your code (remember, the goal is to show yourself different ideas so that when you forget how to do something, you can look at this document!).\n Finally, you must include at least 2 examples of inline code. This could be something that just shows up as looking like code in the text (like this) or it can be something that actually evaluates to a number (even if it doesn’t look like code, I’ll be able to tell because I’ll have your actual .Rmd file to check!)\n    Final thoughts This assignment is not meant to be very difficult, just something you might find helpful. So think back on the past few weeks, and identify some topics that you struggled with. Those are the ones that should go in this document (so hopefully you won’t struggle with them in the future!).

In the previous practice set, you created the following 4 vectors:\nids \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;ID1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID5\u0026quot;) # character state \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Missouri\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Iowa\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Missouri\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Idaho\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Maine\u0026quot;) # character/factor smoker \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) # logical age \u0026lt;- c(20, 18, 32, 25, 25) # numeric You can do something to all elements of the vector:\n# add 10 years to everyone\u0026#39;s age age \u0026lt;- age + 10 age ## [1] 30 28 42 35 35 If you have 2 vectors, these can be combined in a number of ways!\nLet’s try to add the number 2 to the first person’s age, 4, to the second person’s age etc.\nnumbers \u0026lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) age + numbers ## [1] 32 32 48 43 45 You can also append one vector on to the next. Notice that to do this, we use c(). We’re concatenating or combining the two vectors.\nnewVector \u0026lt;- c(age, numbers) newVector ## [1] 30 28 42 35 35 2 4 6 8 10 If you have 2 vectors, but they are not the same length, R will recycle the shorter vector.\nshortVector \u0026lt;- c(1000, 2000) newVector + shortVector ## [1] 1030 2028 1042 2035 1035 2002 1004 2006 1008 2010 If the longer vector is not a multiple of the shorter vector, the process still works but you’ll also get a warning message (notice how it still works, though):\nage + shortVector ## Warning in age + shortVector: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter ## object length ## [1] 1030 2028 1042 2035 1035 You try! The following exercises are a modified version of the sat.act dataset (but broken up into vectors). The SAT \u0026amp; ACT are both standardized college admissions tests in the United States. The ACT technically has 4 parts, but only the overall score is reported here. The SAT is broken up into verbal and quantitative categories:\n age in years act contains scores from the ACT tests; range 1-36, norm ~20 satV contains the Verbal scores from the SAT; range 200-800, avg ~500 satQ contains the quantitative scores from the SAT; range 200-800, avg ~500  Follow the directions above each code chunk!\n   Indexing Nice work! Let’s move on to practicing indexing, specifically with 1-dimensional vectors.\nThink of the index as an address, and your entire vector as a street. Where on the street is the particular object you’re looking for? We want to use that object’s address to find it. To do so, we use the following format:\nVECTOR[index] For example, if I wanted to get the 4th item in the state vector, it would look something like this:\nstate[4]  ## [1] \u0026quot;Idaho\u0026quot;  To check out more than 1 index:\n If the indices you want are in a row:  Use the colon : to get items # through # Ex: 3:5 reads as “items 3 through 5”  If they are NOT in a row:  Make a mini vector with c() Ex: c(1, 4, 18) reads as “items 1, 4, and 18”   You try! Practice indexing on the same sat.act variables from above, including the variables you created! Follow the directions above each code chunk.\n  A Demonstration Let’s say we wanted to find the act scores of everyone that was over the age of 35. The line of code below finds out who is over 35 years old, and stores it as it’s own vector called older. Let’s take a look:\n# find people over 35 yrs old older \u0026lt;- which(age \u0026gt; 35) older ## [1] 10 14 20 21 24 28 35 37 38 43 45 61 62 74 80 81 85 87 90 98 Look at the numbers that printed out. They are not the actual ages! We know this because we asked for people over 35 years old, and there are lots of numbers under 35 here. Our vector older now contains the indices of people over the age of 35!\nThe first item in older…\nolder[1] ## [1] 10 …corresponds to an index in the age vector of someone over the age of 35. Let’s look at the first 15 people in the age vector.\nage[1:15] ## [1] 19 23 20 27 33 26 30 19 23 40 23 34 32 41 20 Notice that the first person over 35 is the 10th person. They are 40 years old. That is why the first number in older is “10”. It’s not the actual age of 40…it’s the “address” of the 40 year old within the age vector; it’s the index!\nWe can use this to our advantage! We wanted to find the act scores of everyone over 35 yrs old. Now that we have our older vector, we don’t need to manually type out the indices!\nactOldScores \u0026lt;- act[older] actOldScores ## [1] 35 35 32 28 30 21 33 28 24 30 36 34 32 32 21 26 28 24 30 33 To verify, we said that the 1st person over the age of 35 was at index #10. Let’s look at the act score for index #10\nact[10] ## [1] 35 That number (which happens to be 35!) matches the very first number in the actOldScores vector. Our code worked! actOldScores represents all the act scores of people over the age of 35.\nFYI: R is kind of weird in that it starts indexing at 1. You should know that most other programming languages begin indexing at 0. R and MATLAB are the only languages I’m aware of that begin at 1. Normally, the first element in the vector has an index of 0. If you plan on also using other programming languages, like python 🐍, then this is something to be aware of.\n  Keep up the great work! Sometimes, it feels like you’re just kind of guessing until you get it right. Coding is kind of like a sport. It takes some time and practice to become good. But by completing this practice set and continuing with this bootcamp, you’re on the right track!\nIf you feel lost at any point, please reach out!\n    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d19cb388740e38652aaf1c2254474a3f","permalink":"/practice/03-practice/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/practice/03-practice/","section":"practice","summary":"Vectors Recap Indexing   Vectors Recap Before diving into indexing, let’s make sure we’re 💯 good with vectors.

You may use any of the datasets posted on Canvas or you may use an outside dataset (must be approved by Shelly). I STRONGLY SUGGEST USING THE SAME DATASET THAT YOU USED ON ASSIGNMENT 1\nRULES\nYou must use a RNotebook for this assignment:\n Sections should have appropriate headers All code must be contained within a code chunk. You are allowed to split up your code into many code chunks, or just have one large chunk per section. That is up to you. However, I do not want to see code located outside of a chunk (unless you’re making a quick note or telling us what you’re doing – but the code outside of a chunk shouldn’t be evaluated). Any explanations I ask for should be outside of a code chunk (aka formatted text). I personally would put this directly underneath the header, but it can come after the code chunk ends, as well. Whatever you prefer. However, I do not want to see any sentences as comments within a code chunk (e.g., #a long sentence like this). Comments within the code is fine in terms of describing what the code is doing. But when I ask for your opinion or an explanation of something, that needs to be formatted text.  You must use the ggplot2 package and syntax for all plotting. No plots in base R.\n  Descriptive Statistics Revisit Assignment 1, especially the Results: Summary Statistics - Part 2 section. After reviewing that, do the following.\nHere’s your to-do list:\n Get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of 3 numeric variables in your dataset, but get these for each level of the categorical variable you chose in Assignment 1. That is, if your categorical variable was “treatment group”, you need the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for those that were in the “control” group and those that were in the “treatment” group. Now that you know more about using R, complete this task in any way except the way you did in Assignment 1. That is, do NOT use indexing and logical vectors. Take those same 3 numeric variables and z-score them. Then make a density plot that has the distribution for all 3 variables overlaid and a figure legend telling you which variable each color represents. It should look similar to the plot on slide 25 of the Descirptives lecture. Add in a vertical line representing the mean of each of the 3 distributions, and make sure it’s labeled (see Descriptives slides for inspiration). You do not need to plot each distribution per level of your categorical variable. Write a few sentences describing the variables analyzed here in this section (your 3 numeric and 1 categorical variable) based on your analyses in the first two bullet points. Additionally, describe why you z-scored the 3 variables before plotting.   Hint: For the second bullet point, think carefully about whether the data should be in the long form or wide form before plotting.\n Sampling Distributions The normal distribution is awesome, and by far and away the most commonly used. But many, many others exist! Luckily, a lot of the principles we learned about with the normal nicely expand to other distributions – including R code!\nLet’s learn about a new distribution, and then you will complete your to-do list with this new one. It’s called the binomial distribution.\nBinomial Distribution This is a theoretical probability distribution (like the normal) that is appropriate when you want to model your expected outcome (X) over a pre-specified number of times (N). However, X, your outcome, must be BINARY (success/failure). For each of your N trials, each trial needs to be independent. The classic example is flipping a coin. The outcomes is binary – it’s either heads or tails. And each trial is independent meaning that if you get a heads on the first toss, that does not influence whether you will get a heads or tails on the next toss. We also need to know how many times we are flipping the coin. Same thing goes for rolling a dice, where rolling the number 6 is considered a “success”.\nAll this sounds very hypothetical, but it’s actually quite useful! For instance, let’s say you run a study on bilingual adults, and you want to know if their reading comprehension in their second language is as good as their first language. You ask them to read a book in their second language and then give them a 20-item multiple choice question exam where the questions are all about that book. Each question has 4 options A, B, C, or D. Getting 14 correct out of 20 items is considered “passing”. However, you are concerned that your study participants might do well by chance alone. You don’t want your participants to pass the multiple choice test if they just showed up for the exam and guessed on each question. So we want to know how likely is it that a guesser would score above the minimum passing threshold (get 14 out of 20 correct)? We can use the binomial distribution where success is 14 or higher and failure is 13 or lower, we have 20 trials, and the probability of each option is the same per trial (that is, the probability of A, B, C, or D is .25 each).\nCopy/paste this entire code chunk into your .Rmd file.\nset.seed(4175) # Let\u0026#39;s create our dataset! # We will first have a column for the test score (getting a 0/20, 1/20, 2/20 etc.) # Then we will have the probability of getting that test score binomData \u0026lt;- data.frame(testScore = 0:20, prob = dbinom(x = 0:20, size = 20, prob = .25)) Here’s your to-do list:\n Make a histogram with each test score on the x-axis (be sure to independently show 0 through 20) against the probability. Now get the probability of guessing 13 items or fewer correct out of 20 items. Get the complement of the above, the probability of getting 14 items or more correct out of 20 items. Write a few sentences describing the distribution that you plotted and the probabilities. Do the probabilities make sense given your plot? If you are just totally lost here, then instead, write out 3 different questions about where you are confused and we will answer! Switch to a new distribution. Specifically, the \\(t\\) distribution. What is the probability of getting a value of .875 or smaller, assuming you had 100 data points (and 99 degrees of freedom because 100-1 = 99)? What is the probability of getting a value of 2.3 or larger, assuming you had 16 data points?   Hint: Check out geom_col instead of geom_histogram. Not sure how to make every number between 0 and 20 show up on your x-axis? You’ll need to Google for how to change the scale of the x-axis.\n Ta-da! You finished! Hooray!\nGo ahead and submit your .Rmd and .html file to Canvas.

Effective use of logic allows you to perform really complex computations with ease. The more comfortable you feel in using these, the better.\nFor the time being, let’s start simple. Check out the R\u0026amp;R slides for more complicated logical operator statements.\nWhat are the operators?\n == equality != inequality (! is read as not) \u0026gt; greater than \u0026gt;= greater than or equal to \u0026lt; less than \u0026lt;= less than or equal to  Logical operators test whether a statement is TRUE or FALSE.\nLet’s revisit our demographics data.frame    SubjectID  Location  SmokerTF  SubjectAge      ID1  Missouri  TRUE  20    ID2  Iowa  FALSE  18    ID3  Missouri  FALSE  32    ID4  Idaho  TRUE  25    ID5  Maine  FALSE  25     TRUE or FALSE: Is anyone from the state of Missouri? To answer this with code, we could do:\ndemographics$Location == \u0026quot;Missouri\u0026quot; ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE The result is a vector of TRUE and FALSE – one for each item in demographics$Location. The 1st and 3rd elements are TRUE, so those people are from “Missouri”. The others are no.\nSpelling, capitalization, and quotation marks count!\nThese things (and missing/extra parentheses) account for at least 75% of all your errors! 🙀 If you’re evaluating a number, you do NOT need quotation marks. If it’s a character string, you do. For example:\n# no quotes around the character string demographics$Location == Missouri ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object \u0026#39;Missouri\u0026#39; not found # capitalization demographics$Location == \u0026quot;missouri\u0026quot; ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ☝️ Note that this doesn’t throw and error, but everything is returned as FALSE. But we know that’s not true…\n# spelling demographics$Location == \u0026quot;Missour-uh\u0026quot; ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Same as the capitalization thing.\nBe careful with = vs ==!\n == is a logical operator = is for assignment. It’s the same thing as \u0026lt;-  Look at the example below.\n Logical operator usage…\n# Is each element in the SubjectID column equal to the character # string \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot;? demographics$SubjectID == \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE Assignment usage…\n# Make each element in the SubjectID column equal to the character # string \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; demographics$SubjectID = \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; # now view the column demographics$SubjectID ## [1] \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; Now that we’ve gone through this demo, let’s change the SubjectID column back to what it’s supposed to look like.\ndemographics$SubjectID \u0026lt;- ids # view the column to double check demographics$SubjectID ## [1] \u0026quot;ID1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID4\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ID5\u0026quot; Quick Quiz\n   Functions Functions are the heart and soul of R, and are especially powerful. They are the verbs of a programming language because the act on the objects. Each function has:\nName that is unique Arguments - What is the verb acting on? How should the function behave? Output or the result of the function (can be anything!) that can be stored to another object  You’ve already seen some functions in action! You just didn’t know it, yet!\nc() is the combine/concatenate function:\n It’s name is c It’s input is whatever you’re trying to combine It’s output is the vector that has the elements combined  data.frame() is the function for making a data.frame:\n It’s name is data.frame It’s input is a series of vectors that all have the same length It’s output is a nicely formatted data.frame  class() is the function for finding out the class of an object:\n It’s name is class It’s input is the object you are examining It’s output is a character telling you what class the object is  Most functions use more arguments than what we’ve seen above. And those arguments have names.\nUse the argument names!\nAutocomplete will help so it’s not so tedious. See the lecture slides for the example with the round() function. When you have multiple arguments, you separate them with a comma function(argument 1 = something, argument 2 = something else).\nYou try! Follow the directions for each chunk below to create different sequences of numbers.\n   Help Pages One of the biggest mistakes I see new coders make is that they pull up the help pages, but don’t actually read them. TAKE THE TIME TO READ THEM! There is a lot of really, really helpful information in there. And they are all organized the same way. See the lecture slides for a breakdown of the Help pages.\nYou can always look at help by typing ?functionName. For example, ?cbind will bring up the help documentation for the function cbind().\nYou try! Follow the directions below each block to ultimately create a plot of standardized variables from our empire dataset. Note that this exercise is intentionally a bit harder than previous exercises – that’s because you’re getting better!\n  FYI: In this exercise, we made a very basic scatter plot. But it’s not very pretty. We will talk a lot about making really pretty plots. You can check out the very basics in the Stats \u0026amp; Plot section, and then we’ll go into a lot more detail when we get to the Data Visualization section.\n Congratulations! You’re making great progress and are well on your way to being a bad@$% programmer!\n   Examples of a few functioins In the corresponding lecture, I listed a couple functions that you might use quite frequently. Below are examples of how to use these functions. Note that you do not need to go through all of them at this time. However, I would encourage you to come back and take a look at some point.\nlength(), nrow(), ncol()  length() is the same as getting the last element’s index position nrow() and ncol() tell you how many rows and columns there are in a data.frame, respectively  length(demographics$SubjectID) ## [1] 5 nrow(demographics) ## [1] 5 ncol(demographics) ## [1] 4 Note that these don’t work properly for any object\n# length on a 2-d object just gives the 2nd dimension (columns) # lots of people get this confused and think it should return the # number of rows! length(demographics) ## [1] 4 # nrow and ncol of a 1-d vector don\u0026#39;t make sense... # there is no such thing as columns or rows in a vector nrow(demographics$SubjectID) ## NULL ncol(demographics$SubjectID) ## NULL  factor() and as.factor() Both of these convert a character vector into a factor. Factors are a special case of character where there is inherent meaning/grouping. Categorical variables.\n(Note: For the life of me, I can’t figure out the difference between factor() and as.factor() 🤷‍♀ so you can think of them as interchangable.)\n# Our \u0026#39;Location\u0026#39; variable consists of states. We might want # to think of this as a categorical variable, where each state # is a meaingfully different category from the next state. # Don\u0026#39;t forget to re-assign the variable so that it stores your new # factor! demographics$Location \u0026lt;- factor(demographics$Location) demographics$Location ## [1] Missouri Iowa Missouri Idaho Maine ## Levels: Idaho Iowa Maine Missouri # To double check, use the `class()` function class(demographics$Location) ## [1] \u0026quot;factor\u0026quot; The LEVELS of a factor are all the different categories. Here, we have 4 states. R will always put these in alphabetical order unless you tell it otherwise (hint: you can change this by modifying one of the arguments).\n table() for quick counts Especially good for factors \u0026amp; logicals!\n# how many states are in each category? table(demographics$Location) ## ## Idaho Iowa Maine Missouri ## 1 1 1 2 # states x smoker table table(demographics$Location, demographics$SmokerTF) ## ## FALSE TRUE ## Idaho 0 1 ## Iowa 1 0 ## Maine 1 0 ## Missouri 1 1  cbind() and rbind() for adding columns and rows, respectively These are for if you have a vector that you want to add to a data.frame. You should make sure there’s the same number of items – which changes depending on if you’re adding a row or a column!\nLet’s add a column consisting of survey scores, on a scale of 1 to 10. Then we’ll add a row.\n# first, let\u0026#39;s add a column for surveys. there are currently # 5 rows/observations, so we\u0026#39;ll want 5 elements in this vector survey \u0026lt;- c(6, 4, 10, 2, 8) # now use cbind() to add it to your data.frame # the 1st argument is the data.frame # the 2nd argument is the thing you want to add to it # (you\u0026#39;re combining BOTH things) # note that we re-assign the entire data.frame demographics \u0026lt;- cbind(demographics, survey) # print it out to view demographics ## SubjectID Location SmokerTF SubjectAge survey ## 1 ID1 Missouri TRUE 20 6 ## 2 ID2 Iowa FALSE 18 4 ## 3 ID3 Missouri FALSE 32 10 ## 4 ID4 Idaho TRUE 25 2 ## 5 ID5 Maine FALSE 25 8 ############ # now let\u0026#39;s add a row. there are 5 columns, so we need to add an # element that will match up with each column newParticipant \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;ID6\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Iowa\u0026quot;, FALSE, 28, 5) # now use rbind() to bind by rows # the 1st argument is the data.frame # the 2nd argument is the row you want to add to it.

Vectors will always take on the least specific class So newParticipant is considered a character vector because all of it’s elements could be thought of as characters, but not everything could be considered numeric or logical. This means that when we added it to the demographics data.frame, it made any column that wasn’t already a character into characters!\nclass(demographics$SubjectID) ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; class(demographics$Location) # factors are special characters ## [1] \u0026quot;factor\u0026quot; class(demographics$SmokerTF) ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; class(demographics$SubjectAge) ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; class(demographics$survey) ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; However, the last 3 columns should NOT be characters.

However, the are WAY more functions out there in the world! They are stored in packages, and are free/easy to download and use at your convenience.\nThis is a huge part of what makes R awesome. Anyone from around the world (including you!) can write their own custom function. And if you think “hey, other people might want to use this cool function” you can publish it in a package.\nPackages also often contain datasets that are great to work with. At the very bottom of a function’s ?help page, there are Examples of how to use that function. Often, these examples use datasets that come from the same package the function comes from.\nThere are 2 steps to getting/using functions/datasets in a package:\nInstall the package  You need to be connected to the internet You need to know the exact name of the package You only do this ONCE (equivalent of installing Microsoft Word on your computer)  Load the package in your R session  You do NOT need to be connected to the internet You need to know the exact name of the pacakge You need to do this every time you open R and want to use the function/dataset   For installing and loading packages, you can either do this a) via code or b) via the RStudio interface in the Packages tab on the lower right hand portion of the screen (see corresponding lecture video for more). In my opinion…\n It is totally OK to use the RStudio interface to install packages since you only do this once. However, I strongly suggest using code for loading packages. The reason is that you often write some code, save the file, and come back to it later. If you use functions from certain packages in that file, then you need to remember which packages you used – easier said than done! So it’s easier to write the code and keep it in that same file (usually at the top) so that you always have all the packages you need for a given script.  Installing packages with code To install a package, we use the install.packages() function\ninstall.packages(\"packageName\") ☝️ Here we have:\nThe function install.packages in blue Quotation marks around the package name The package’s name   Loading packages with code To load a package, we use the library() function\nlibrary(packageName) ☝️ Here we have:\nThe function library in blue The package’s name  Note how there are NO quotation marks when loading a package!\n  Miscellaneous Before you practice installing and loading packages, there are a couple random tidbits you should know about.\nSome packages come pre-installed with R (you can look at your Packages tab and see that stuff is already there!). This is referred to as base R. You do not need to load any special packages to use their functions. For example, the c() function is part of base R.\n Do NOT re-install a package you already have. R doesn’t like it, and can sometimes get confused. Always check your Packages tab first to see if you have the package.\n When you install a package, you often see a lot of stuff happening in your console, and it’s often in red font. So it looks like R is yelling at you. But it’s OK, R is not yelling at you – so don’t sweat it. Most of the time, it’s loading dependencies (other packages that the current one you are trying to install depends on).\nSimilarly, when you load a package, sometimes messages are printed out along with it. Usually these are just helpful little tidbits, but the package still loads successfully.\n One of those little messages that might print out is something like:\nlibrary(psych) library(ggplot2) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39; ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:psych\u0026#39;: ## ## %+%, alpha Last time, we learned that functions have a unique name. This is true for all functions within a package! But every so often, there is 1 name that corresponds to functions from 2 different packages. In this example, there is a function called alpha() in the psych package AND a function called alpha() in the ggplot2 package.\nR will use the function from whichever package you loaded MOST RECENTLY. So here, the alpha() from psych is “masked” or hidden by alpha() from ggplot2. That is, the ggplot2 version of alpha() will be the default.\nYou can still use alpha() from the psych package though! You just need to add a double colon, like this: psych::alpha().\nThe way this manifests is you write some code, and it doesn’t work. And you get an error that is like function expects a data.frame when in reality, the function you are thinking of should actually have a single number as an input. That error, that it’s expecting something you’re not giving, can be a clue that R is calling the wrong function.\n When you install a package, you sometimes will get a message in the console that is something like There are binary versions available but the source versions are later. Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compliation? y/n.\nIf this happens, go ahead and type y in your console (for Yes). This will get you the latest version of the package, but it might take slightly longer to install (not too much longer!).\nWINDOWS USERS: you might want to consider installing a package called rtools40 (see here) to help with installing these “source” versions. Although I wouldn’t worry much about it unless it comes up.\n Keep your software up to date on your computer! Life will be so much easier for you. I know people tend to avoid this because they’re scared of losing stuff. But you should be saving everything of importance to a cloud-based service (Box, Dropbox, Github, OSF etc.). So even if your desktop is wiped clean, it shouldn’t matter. Act as though your computer could get stolen at any moment. You certainly wouldn’t want to lose your entire thesis or all of your work files because someone stole your stuff… Save appropriately!\nSome suggestions:\n Update your operating system when it prompts you (within a reasonable timeframe) Right after updating your operating system is a good time to check if R needs to update. Note, this is R…not RStudio. If you haven’t updated your operating system in a while, I would check if R needs an update about every 6 months. Right after you update R, then I suggest checking for updates on RStudio. If you haven’t updated R for a while, then I would check if RStudio needs an update about every 6 months. Sometimes, I find that I need to re-install all of my packages after an RStudio update. But not always. It’s kind of annoying, but frankly it doesn’t take that long to get everything back up to speed. Right after you update RStudio, I would check if any of your packages need to be updated. Go to the Packages tab and click Update. I personally do chunks of ~5-10 packages at a time, just to make sure they all update properly. I do this after updating RStudio. It will sometimes ask you to restart RStudio before updating your packages – that’s OK, go ahead and restart. I usually only update my packages immediately after updating RStudio, but it doesn’t hurt to check every so often.\n   You try! Open up RStudio on your computer.\nStep 1: Go to your Packages tab. Check to see if you have the following packages:\n tidyverse we will talk about this at length after finishing The Basics psych great for many statistics used in psychology and social sciences broom great for making the output of statistical models into organized data.frames RColorBrewer we will use this to make color palettes when we do data visualization ggpubr we will use this to make multi-panel figures when we do data visualization knitr we will use this to generate reports when we do reproducibility kableExtra we will use this to make pretty tables in our reports when we do reproducibility  Step 2: For any of these packages listed that you DO NOT HAVE in your Packages tab, install them.\nStep 3: Open a new script and load all of these packages.\nRemember, you might get some messages about what’s installed or what’s “masked” (see notes above). But contact me/send screenshots if you have other errors like “package cannot be loaded”. Hopefully it should work seamlessly!\n With packages at your fingertips, you now have most of the tools you need to be and R programmer! The next few sections help refine and practice these skills.

You’ll likely need to refer to it.\n Setup: We will be using the same midus.csv dataset for this practice.

Your choice. - Import the data file. You should already have this downloaded, but just in case, here it is again. Make sure the code you use to import the file winds up in your script!\n  midus.csv  Load the package ggplot2 Make sure the variables sex, heart_self, and heart_father are treated as factor() variables. Use the same na.omit() function from the 8: R\u0026amp;R slides to remove all NA variables. Look at the first 6 rows of the midus data.frame by using the head() function.      Plotting with ggplot2 You can make plots with base R (we’ve done this once already!). But they’re kinda ugly. Actually, they’re really ugly. So we’re going to use a package called ggplot2 to make prety plots. This practice set will go through the very basics of how to use ggplot2. For more control over your plots, check out the Data Viz section.\ngg stands for the “grammar of graphics”. It’s syntax (or code format) is the same as what we’ve already been doing using functions and objects. However, like the lovable ogre Shrek, ggplot2 has layers. Each layer corresponds to one aspect of the plot.\nThe basic layout of ggplot2 is:\nggplot(things that impact the entire plot) +\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;geom_something(things that impact just the something) ☝️ Here we have:\n 2 different FUNCTIONS:  ggplot is the function for the first layer. geom_something is the function for the second layer, where the something is replaced with a plot type. For example, geom_point is a scatter plot and geom_histogram is a histogram.  Each of these functions takes ARGUMENTS:  The arguments control what you want the plot to look like. Many arguments are actually aesthetics and wrapped within aes().  If your argument depends on the data, it’s wrapped in an aes() If your argument does not depend on the data, it does not need to be in an aes()  In the first layer (within ggplot), this will contain things that impact the whole plot. Like your x- and y- axes and what data you’re actually plotting. In the second layer (within geom_something), this will contain things that impact only that layer. If you have a histogram, how wide should the bins be? What color should the bars be? Etc.  Each layer is separated by a + sign. This tells R “hey wait, I’m not done yet”.  It should ALWAYS go at the very end of each line…never at the beginning of a new line. You do not need one on the very last line of your plot code (here, there’s not one after geom_something) because after the last line, you’re ready for R to run your code.   Example on aesthetics/arguments from the slides ## here() starts at /Users/coop/Psych4175 No arguments or aesthetics into geom_point layer (the default):\nggplot(data = midus, aes(x = age, y = BMI)) + geom_point() Argument in geom_point layer. But it is NOT dependent on the data. “Make all the points corn flower blue”. Note that the color is within quotes.\nggplot(data = midus, aes(x = age, y = BMI)) + geom_point(color = \u0026quot;cornflowerblue\u0026quot;) Argument in geom_point layer. But it IS dependent on the data. “Make the points different color based on the sex factor variable”. Since it’s dependent on the data, we wrap it within an aes(). Note that sex is not in quotes.\nggplot(data = midus, aes(x = age, y = BMI)) + geom_point(aes(color = sex))   Statistics The corresponding slides go through a variety of basic statistical tests. They are:\n t.test() cor() and cor.test() aov lm  Use the slides as a guide to complete the following exercises using stats and plotting.\n\\(t\\)-test You try! Is there a difference in life satisfaction between people who have had heart problems compared to people who have not had heart problems?\n Statistic: \\(t\\)-test Plot: Boxplot  Bonus:\n Look at the help page for t.test(). How do you run a one-tailed \\(t\\)-test? Run it! Does your answer change? How could you fill the boxplots so that males and females are shown in different colors? Look at the help page for labs() and see if you can give your plot a title and different x- \u0026amp; y-axes labels.     Correlation You try! Does age correlate with BMI?\n Statistic: Correlation Plot: Scatter plot  Bonus:\n Set the size of all points to be 1.5 Change the x- \u0026amp; y-axes labels and add a title and subtitle Make the shape of the points different based on if they’ve ever been diagnosed with a heart issue or not     ANOVA You try! Is there a main effect of age_category, a main effect of heart_self, and is there a age_category x heart_self interaction on BMI?\n Statistic: 3x2 ANOVA Plot: Bar plot   Setup for analysis As of now, we don’t have an age_category variable. The code below trichotomizes age into the following groups:\n 28-40 years old = “young” 41-60 years old = “middle” 60-84 years old = “old”  Additionally, bar plots can kind of suck. The height of each bar should be the mean of the dependent variable for each group. After the trichotomizing code, I have written several lines of code to help you get all the data you need. Whenever you see an empty set of quotation marks \"\", you need to fill in the blanks (HINT: read the variable names!).\nFinally, at the very bottom of the chunk, we make a data.frame based on everything from the middle chunk. You do NOT need to change this part of the code. But do try to understand what it’s doing!\n  Now, run the analysis Now that you’ve done the hard work of making your categorical variable and your data.frame of means for the plot, go ahead and write/run code for the ANOVA and bar plot!\n (Again, we will learn how to do this analysis prep in a MUCH easier way when we talk about the tidyverse)\n  Regression You try!\nDoes self-reported physical health predict self-reported mental health? Do self-reported physical health and self-reported heart problems predict self-reported mental health (without an interaction)? Same as above but now including a self-reported physical health and self-reported heart problems interaction.

You try! The code below is broken. Your job is to fix it!\n   Bubble Plots Bubble plots are a lot like scatter plots with an extra size dimension (See here for more). In ggplot2, it’s easy to make! All you have to do is put the size argument inside of aes().\nCheck it out!\nggplot(data = midus, aes(x = self_esteem, y = life_satisfaction)) + geom_point(alpha = .5, aes(size = hostility)) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Self-Esteem\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Life Satisfaction\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Bubble Plot\u0026quot;) Note that bubble plots are awesome if you work with spatial data (think of a map where a bubble might represent population density).\n Color Palettes \u0026amp; Themes In the lecture slides, we talked about making your plot pretty with color palettes, especially with RColorBrewer. You can use the function display.brewer.all() function to find palettes that you like. It also has very helpful arguments to narrow down the palettes you might like.\nYou try!\nLook up the help documentation for display.brewer.all() - Use this function to find a color palette that is good for 3 colors - Include the argument type = \"qual\" - Use an argument to make your color palette colorblind friendly - Pick whichever palette you like, and use it in the code below (in the exercise boxes) Change the overall theme to be more minimalist You might find that some of the categories overlap. Make an adjustment so you can see each distribution more clearly.   Look up the help documentation for display.brewer.all() Look for the different parameters listed in the box above.\n  Now implement your color palette and theme changes Edit the code below to make the plot according to the specifications in the box above (a color palette, a theme, and an adjustment to make the overlapping categories easier to read).\n   The Ugliest Plot in the World You try! The code below makes THE ugliest plot ever. Your job is to work backwards and turn this into a plot that is publication-ready (and not super ugly). Do so without deleting any whole layers. Just modify the existing code.\n  You’re doing GREAT!

There are two main ways of faceting: - facet_grid will create a grid or matrix of sub-plots - facet_wrap will lay out each sub-plot kind of like a ribbon\nYou try! Imagine each of the 3740 midus observations were randomly assigned to belong to one of two groups. Add to the code below to facet based on session and this new group variable. The result should include 4 subplots. Organize them such that they are in a 2x2 layout, with group 1 in the left column, group 2 in the right column, session1 in the first row, and session2 in the second row.\n  You try! Now, use facet_wrap to get sub-plots reflecting all 3 factor variables (age_category, group, and session). How many sub-plots should you wind up with? Organize them such that there are 3 columns.\n   Adding Lines You can use geom_vline and geom_hline to make vertical and horizontal lines, respectively. You’ll need to specify a x- or y-intercept.\nOften, we want these lines to be based on summary statistics. This is where the tidyverse comes in very handy!\nYou try! Change the code below to represent the mean of self_esteem per age_category.\n Plot these means as horizontal lines HINT: You do NOT need to change the meansSelfEsteem code, only the plotting code BONUS: How can you get rid of the legend that shows the line type?

There are 4 problems, each ramping up in terms of difficulty and points:\n Easiest, .5 points A little harder, 1 point A little harder still, 1.5 points Hardest, 2 points  You need to edit the code chunks to create the correct output. You will be graded on accuracy! Specifically, you need to get the correct output.\nDO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE CHUNK PARAMETERS UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED. The only things in this markdown file you should change are the names in the YAML header, and you should edit the actual code chunks. I will not ask you for any text responses, and I don’t want you to change any of the RMarkdown parameters.\nYou’ve all been doing great this semester, so I am confident you will do well on this, too.\nLet’s get to it!\n Question 1 (.5 points) I have created 2 vectors. One with 5 digit numbers and the other with 4 digit numbers. We are going to pretend these are real zip codes. Your job is to create a vector called zipcodes that takes the full 9 digit form, with a hyphen in between. For instance, Wash U’s zip code is 63130-4899. This is the form that we want our final vector to be in.\nEdit the for loop below to create the output.\n# First, remove the `, eval=FALSE` from the above chunk parameter, so that it only says \u0026quot;```{r}\u0026quot; # Do NOT edit lines 33-36 set.seed(1234) fives \u0026lt;- sample(x = 10000:99999, size = 1000) fours \u0026lt;- sample(x = 1000:9999, size = 1000) # edit this code for (i in 1:) zipcodes \u0026lt;- paste0(fives[i], \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, fours[i]) }  ## Error: \u0026lt;text\u0026gt;:10:13: unexpected \u0026#39;)\u0026#39; ## 9: # edit this code ## 10: for (i in 1:) ## ^  Question 2 (1 point) Iterate through a dataframe\nThe bfi dataset is part of the psych package. It shows 25 personality items representing 5 factors (or the Big 5).\n Column names beginning with “O” belong to the factor “Openness” Column names beginning with “C” belong to the factor “Conscientiousness” Column names beginning with “A” belong to the factor “Agreeableness” Column names beginning with “N” belong to the factor “Neuroticism” Column names beginning with “E” belong to the factor “Extraversion”  You need to create a composite variable for each of the 5 factors, per individual.\nBelow is a skeleton of the code, but it doesn’t quite work. Your job is to fix it!\nThe only package you need is the psych package for accessing the dataset. The goal is to practice for loops. Not other functions.\nlibrary(psych) bfi$Openness \u0026lt;- NA bfi$Conscientiousness \u0026lt;- na ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object \u0026#39;na\u0026#39; not found bfi$Agreeableness \u0026lt;- NA bfi$Neuroticism \u0026lt;- NA bfi$Extraversion \u0026lt;- NA for (i in 1:nrow(bfi)) { bfi$Openness \u0026lt;- (bfi[i,21] + bfi[i,22] + bfi[i,23] + bfi[i,24] + bfi[i,25])/5 bfi$Conscientiousness[i] \u0026lt;- (bfi[i,6] + bfi[i,7] + bfi[i,8] + bfi[i,9] + bfi[i,10])/5 bfi$Agreeableness[i] \u0026lt;- (bfi[i,1] + bfi[i,2] + bfi[i,3] + bfi[i,4] + bfi[i,5])/5 bfi$Neuroticism[i] \u0026lt;- bfi[i,16] + bfi[i,17] + bfi[i,18] + bfi[i,19] + bfi[i,20] bfi$Extraversion[i] \u0026lt;- (bfi[11,i] + bfi[12,i] + bfi[13,i] + bfi[14,i] + bfi[15,i])/5 } ## Error in bfi$Extraversion[i] \u0026lt;- (bfi[11, i] + bfi[12, i] + bfi[13, i] + : replacement has length zero  Question 3 (1.5 points) We are going to play a game. It’s called Fizz Buzz. You are going to print integers 1 to 50, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.\nTo do this, let’s introduce you to the modulus operator. We use 2 percent signs, like this %%. It returns the remainder of a division. So for instance 4 %% 2 will result in 0. That’s because 2 goes into 4 evenly. There is no remainder after that division! If you instead did 17 %% 7 the result would be 3. That’s because 7 goes into 17 two times, but there are 3 left over. This is often used to figure out if something is an even number or not.\nYou’re going to make this one from scratch. Think carefully about the logic you want! I have provided you with the 100 numbers, and the empty vector called game. At the end, we’re going to print your vector.\nfizzbuzz_numbers \u0026lt;- 1:100 game \u0026lt;- c() # your code goes here print(game) ## NULL Why am I having you play Fizz Buzz? Because it is easily one of the most popular interview questions in all of data science, software engineering, developer positions etc. In fact, my husband uses it in his interview process for new coders! So if you’re hoping to go into industry, you’ll definitely need to know this one. It’s also an excellent test of thinking logically.\n Question 4 (2 points) Last one!\nWe have talked about nested functions. Arguably, even more important though is nested for loops. I have used this in my own work quite a bit! Something like “for each cognitive task performed and for each time point, do something”.\nWe’re going to start small. Use 2 nested for loops to create a 20x20 multiplication table.\nI do not want you using any extra packages or functions. And you do not need to format anything special.\nI have created an empty matrix. Use your nested for loops to fill in the matrix.\nHINT: If you think of this as a data.frame, the first loop goes through the rows and the second loop goes through the columns. Normally we use i for “each”. But now you’ll need each row and each column. You might need an extra letter.\n# We\u0026#39;re only doing 20x20.

You should watch the videos and follow along for each topic that is assigned per week.  Mondays:\n We will first complete peer reviews (if there was an assignment for the previous week’s material). Practice (): This page contains an interactive lesson that reinforces the principles that were discussed in the corresponding lecture. They also tend to go through more detail. We will go through this as a class, but you are able to practice on your own, too. Note that I will not be re-lecturing the material; watching the lectures is your homework. 1 out of 1.5 of your participation points each week will come from here! If I ask you questions when we go through material, and it is clear you have not watched the lectures, you will be docked participation.  Wednesdays:\n Assignment (): This page contains the instructions for each assignment. All items in the green to-do list boxes are part of the assignment. The entire class period on Wednesdays is dedicated to you doing the assignment. I am around to help when you get stuck. You will need to finish the assignment at home if you do not complete it in class. Assignments are due by 1pm on the following MONDAY. Ex: On Wednesday 9/15 you will work on Assignment 1. It covers the lecture material in Week 3. Assignment 1 is due the following Monday (9/22) at 1pm. However, you should be able to complete the vast majority of Assignment 1 during class on Wednesday 9/15. Attendance will be taken on Wednesdays, and will constitute the other .5 points of the 1.5 participation points.  Exceptions to the rule:\n The first week is an exception; normal lecture style Any week where we only have 1 class period, it will be a normal lecture style  tl;dr: You should follow this general process:\n Watch the Lectures () at home before each Monday’s class Come prepared on Monday to assist the class with the Practice sets () Come prepared on Wednesday to work your way through each Assignment () If needed, finish the Assignment () at home, and start watching next week’s Lectures ()      Unit 1: Learning R Lecture Practice Assignment   Week 1: 8/30 - 9/1 Welcome Lecture Practice Assignment    Syllabus \u0026amp; Installation         R \u0026amp; RStudio        Week 2: 9/6 (no class) - 9/8 Files Lecture Practice Assignment    Loading Files       Week 3: 9/13 - 9/15 The Basics Part 1 Lecture Practice Assignment    Objects       Indexing       Objects Part 2       Functions \u0026amp; Help      Week 4: 9/20 - 9/22 The Basics Part 2 Lecture Practice Assignment    Packages       Review and Random       Statistics and Intro to Plotting      Week 5: 9/27 - 9/29 Data Wrangling Lecture Practice Assignment    Introduction to Tidyverse        Using Dplyr       Using Tidyr      Week 6: 10/4 - 10/6 Data Visualization Lecture Practice Assignment    Introduction to Data Visualization       Customizing Your Plots       Multipanel Figures       Layers on Layers on Layers       Week 7: 10/11 (no class) - 10/13 Reproducibility Lecture Practice Assignment    Introduction to RMarkdown       Markdown Anatomy        Endless Flexibility        Unit 2: Statistics Lecture Practice Assignment   Week 8: 10/18 - 10/20 Describing Data Lecture Practice Assignment    Descriptives        Normal \u0026amp; Sampling Distributions       Week 9: 10/25 - 10/27 Comparing Means \u0026amp; Stats Issues Lecture Practice Assignment    Comparing Means        Power \u0026amp; Problems       Week 10: 11/1 - 11/3 Relationships Lecture Practice Assignment    Correlation        Regression       Week 11: 11/8 - 11/10 Above and Beyond Lecture Practice Assignment    Interactions         Advanced Stats         Unit 3: Advanced Topics Lecture Practice Assignment   Week 12: 11/15 - 11/17 Bootstrapping \u0026amp; For Loops      Week 13: 11/22 - 11/24 (no class) Data Viz Theory        Week 14: 11/29 - 12/1 Writing Functions      Week 15: 12/6 - 12/8 Simulations      Due 12/20 Final Project        \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3e223d7ba58b0122b42458e4cf52e04c","permalink":"/schedule/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/","section":"","summary":"Here’s your roadmap for this course!\nBefore Every Monday’s Class:\n Lectures (): This contains the lecture slides and video recordings of these lectures.

Applied Statistical Analysis with R (Psych 4175) Mondays/Wednesdays 1-2:20pm Mallinckrodt 303   Who am I? Instructor: Shelly Cooper (she/her) You can reach Shelly via the contact form on the homepage of this site, or you can email her at shelly.cooper@wustl.edu.\n What’s the course philosophy? Programming \u0026amp; statistics are in demand skills across a wide variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and other related disciplines. The goal of this course is for you to feel comfortable with the programmatic skills needed to take a data analysis project from start to finish including data wrangling, executing appropriate statistical tests, interpreting the results, and communicating your findings. Although we will use R software, the core concepts should carry with you to other programming languages (Python, MATLAB etc.).\n The only difference between a beginner and expert programmer, is that the expert is better at Googling”.\n My goal is to get you to the point where you can effectively Google R-related questions and mostly understand the results.\n What will you learn in this class? By the end of the class, you will have learned:\n The fundamentals of programming with R statistical software. This includes objects, data classes, functions, data wrangling, plotting/graphing, and making reproducible reports The fundamentals of basic statistics including distributions, correlations, t-tests, ANOVAs, and linear regression A knowledge base in which to expand your statistical horizons by using more sophisticated code, such as bootstrapping and writing your own functions (make your code work for you!)   How is this course organized? There will be 3 units:\nGetting you up to speed with coding in R. Recap of statistics learned in Psych 300 (Intro to Psych Stats). However, the material will focus on the application of these tests in R, accessing their results, and incorporating them into academic manuscripts. More advanced topics in terms of writing code that can expand your statistical horizons.  This is a flipped classroom meaning your homework is to watch the lectures. Our in-class time will be dedicated to hands-on problem sets. For a roadmap of the class, please see the Schedule page of this website.\n What do you need for this course? You’ll need 4 things:\nYou need R and it’s buddy RStudio. We will go through this together. You need this website – most of the content will take place on this website. While not required, I very strongly suggest being apart of our Slack workspace. You can quickly and easily ask Shelly questions privately or publicly so your peers can learn too. You can interact with your peers, and enjoy remarkably silly memes. Our Canvas page will contain your grades, datasets, and will be where you complete your peer code reviews.   How do I get a good grade? There are no exams! Hooray! To get a good grade in this class, you need to do the following:\n Assignments will be posted on the course website. These are mostly weekly assignments, and they are there to make sure you get lots of practice.  The first 8 assignments will be completed on your own The remaining 3 assignments will be completed with your peer buddy  Peer Reviews will give you practice looking at other peoples’ code and will give you consistent feedback from someone other than the instructor/AI. You will be randomly assigned to a peer in your class and you will answer very specific questions about the assignment. Final Project You will complete a final take-home project due during finals week (if you want to turn it in before then, that’s OK!). This project will be completely R-based, and will incorporate skills learned over the semester with extra emphasis on those learned in Unit 3. This will be completed on your own. Participation refers to answering questions in class. This is to keep you honest about watching lectures at home (see Schedule page for more details).  \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\text{Solo Assignments 8 x 10 pts/ea = 80pts} \\\\ \\text{Peer Reviews 8 x 7.5pts/ea = 60pts} \\\\ \\text{Group Assignments 3 x 10pts/ea = 30pts} \\\\ \\text{Final Project 1 x 15pts/ea = 15pts} \\\\ \\text{Participation 10 x 1.5pts/ea = 15pts} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\text{Total = 200pts}} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\]\n Final Grade Rubric \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \u0026amp; \\text{\u0026gt; 100% = A+} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{93% - 99.99% = A} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{90% - 92.99% = A-} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{87% - 89.99% = B+} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{83% - 86.99% = B} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{80% - 82.99% = B-} \\\\ \\end{split} \\begin{split} \u0026amp; \\text{77% - 79.99% = C+} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{73% - 76.99% = C} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{70% - 72.99% = C-} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{67% - 69.99% = D+} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{63% - 66.99% = D} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{60% - 62.99% = D-} \\\\ \u0026amp;\\text{\u0026lt; 50% = F} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\]\n Staying Connected The 2020-2021 academic year was lonely. Although we’re back in person, we still might feel that residual loneliness. On top of that, learning to code can be really scary – impostor syndrome is real! The best thing we can do to combat these feelings is to stay connected to one another. Here’s how we’ll accomplish this in our class:\n Your peer review will be with the same person! This way, you will get to know your buddy over the course of the semester. Make a friend!\n We will have a dedicated class Slack workspace (see homepage of website for link). You can post questions that everyone can see, or make use of direct messaging. Shelly will respond to your questions on slack (if your peers don’t respond first!). This is really great for one-off questions, or need some quick clarification on. We will also have a dedicated channel for silly programming and stats memes, because humor is important when you’re learning a skill like coding, in which you’ll repeatedly fail. Slack is not required per se, but it is highly encouraged.\n   Let’s learn from COVID-19 That year sucked. But instead of burying our heads in the sand and forgetting it existed, let’s at least extract some things and incorporate them into our lives. For this class, here’s what that means:\n It is OK to not be OK. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I’m not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you will do the same for me. I will work with you to make sure we have a reasonable plan in place should something come up. However, this does require you telling me “hey, I’m not OK”. You are always welcome to come talk to me about things that you’re going through. If I can’t help you, I usually know someone who can help – or I can at least give you some resources and point you in the right direction. If you are struggling or need extra help, please just ask. I promise I will work with you.  Online Etiquette There will be a lot of online communication with the instructor, the AI, and your peers. You are expected to maintain a polite and respectful tone in their online discourse. Some things to consider:\n Any communication shared privately may become public, so be mindful of what you share in discussion boards or chats. This is especially true for sharing any personal and/or identifying information about you or someone else. Do not share any passwords or divulge any personal information (yours or others) that can be used in a malicious manner (phone numbers, addresses etc.). Humor doesn’t always translate in an online forum. If you want to make a joke or a sarcastic remark, be 100% sure that it is clear you are joking. Your comments must be readable to everyone, therefore I ask that you please refrain from using shortcuts. For example, please type out “you” instead of “u”. Very common acronyms are OK (“lol” or “haha”). But please refrain from acronyms that are not as well-known (“fwiw” etc.). Treat your classmates, professor, and AI with kindness and respect. Any indication of online harassment or bullying will not be tolerated and will be reported. This is especially pertinent when giving constructive feedback in code reviews. Please avoid using ALL CAPS because it can be interpreted as yelling.
