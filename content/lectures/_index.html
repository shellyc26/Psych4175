<p>These pages contain the lecture slides and videos, and are organized by topic.</p>
<p>First, you will see a YouTube playlist. Sometimes there will only be 1 video, other times there will be multiple short videos. <strong>You are expected to watch these videos!</strong></p>
<p>Below the YouTube playlist, you will find the lecture slides. The slides are embedded on each page. You can click in the slides and navigate through them with <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> and <kbd>‚Üí</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands.</p>
<p>You will also find these two buttons directly above the slides:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF of all slides</span>
</p>
<p>They will allow you to open the slides in a new tab (to make them bigger) or to download a PDF copy of the slides (for printing or storing). I recommend using one of these features in order to make the slides larger and easier to see. But as I get older, my vision gets worse üëì ‚Äì so do whatever works for you!</p>
<p>Remember, here‚Äôs the order of operations for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the lecture videos</li>
<li>While watching the videos, simultaneous follow along with the slides</li>
<li>Complete that topic‚Äôs corrsponding Practice set</li>

</ul>
