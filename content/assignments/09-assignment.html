<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>
<p>You must use a RNotebook for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections should have appropriate headers</li>
<li>All code must be contained within a code chunk. You are allowed to split up your code into many code chunks, or just have one large chunk per section. That is up to you. However, I do <em>not</em> want to see code located outside of a chunk (unless you’re making a quick note or telling us what you’re doing – but the code outside of a chunk shouldn’t be evaluated).</li>
<li>Any explanations I ask for should be <em>outside</em> of a code chunk (aka formatted text). I personally would put this directly underneath the header, but it can come after the code chunk ends, as well. Whatever you prefer. However, I do not want to see any sentences as comments within a code chunk (e.g., <code>#a long sentence like this</code>). Comments within the code is fine in terms of describing what the code is doing. But when I ask for your opinion or an explanation of something, that needs to be formatted text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must use the <code>ggplot2</code> package and syntax for all plotting. No plots in <code>base R</code>.</p>

<div id="interactions-on-interactions" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactions on Interactions</h2>
<p>You are about to run 3 different regression models that all include interactions. You will need a continuous outcome (DV), 2 continuous predictors, and 2 categorical predictors. I very strongly suggest that for your categorical predictors you only include 2 or 3 levels. Make sure that there is more than 1 observation in each of those levels. For example, those of you using the <code>superhero</code> dataset, you might want to use the <code>publisher</code> variable. However, there are like 20 different publishers. I would pick 2 that have a lot of observations. This will make your interpretation much, much easier.</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Run a regression model with both of your continuous variables as your predictors. Make sure to include an interaction term!
<ul>
<li>Interpret the intercept and all regression coefficients</li>
<li>Interpret the omnibus test and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></li>
<li>Visualize this model in any way you find appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run a regression model with one continuous variable and one categorical variable as your predictors. Make sure to include an interaction term!
<ul>
<li>Interpret the intercept and all regression coefficients</li>
<li>Interpret the omnibus test and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></li>
<li>Visualize this model in any way you find appropriate</li>
