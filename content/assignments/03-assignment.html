<div id="testing-things" class="section level2">
<h2>Testing Things</h2>
<p>The first part is going to be a test run to see if a particular type of document works with your computer. It should, but we’re going to test it out here just in case. You do NOT need to submit the test file.</p>
<div id="warning" class="section level4">
<h4>WARNING</h4>
<p>The following section requires the internet. Please make sure you have a stable connection before completing the exercise. <strong>PLEASE tell me <em>as soon as possible</em> if any errors come up.</strong> This will be a large part of what we will be doing next week, so if it’s not working, we need to get it worked out <em><strong>BEFORE</strong></em> you continue on to the Reproducibility section.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ ALL OF THE STEPS BELOW <em>BEFORE</em> ACTUALLY TRYING IT</strong>. Follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p><strong>In your console</strong> set your working directory somewhere. It doesn’t really matter where, as long as you can easily find it.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Next, open a new R Notebook. You can do this via <code>File &gt; New File &gt; R Notebook</code> or by clicking the white paper with <font color='green'>green plus sign</font> from the top left corner (this is the same as opening a new R script) and choosing R Notebook. It should look something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm1.png" width = "70%">
</center>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Next, find the button at the top that says <code>Preview</code> and click the arrow next to it. You should get a drop down menu. Select <code>Knit to HTML</code>. It should look like this:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm2.png" width = "50%"></p>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm3.png" width = "70%">
</center>
<p>It will prompt you to save the file. That’s OK! Give it a name like <code>testNotebook</code> or whatever you’d like.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Finally, you should see something that pops up, and it should look like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm4.png" width = "70%">
</center>
<p>As long as the final thing shown above popped up, you’re good! It’s ok if you see a lot of scary stuff in the console after. But, if the thing above did <em>not</em> pop up, please take a screen shot of the scary console text! It will be easier for me to help you if I can see the message. Scary text that is actually OK might look like:</p>
<center>
<img src="../miscfigs/figure-html/rm5.png" width = "70%">
</center>
</div>
</div>
<div id="actual-assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Actual Assignment</h2>
<p>You MUST use either the <code>nhanes_small_assignment3.csv</code> or <code>superheroData_assignment3.csv</code> datasets! These have been modified specifically for this assignment. You can find both on Canvas (Week 3 Module &gt; Datasets for Assignment 3.</p>
<div id="introduction-script-prep" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction: Script Prep</h3>
<p>Open a new script file and complete this assignment (the same way you’ve been doing for previous assignments).</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of your script, read in your dataset, load in the <code>tidyverse</code> package</li>
<li>Write a comment that confirms that the above test run thing worked.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="methods-data-wrangling" class="section level3">
<h3>Methods: Data Wrangling</h3>
<p>Let’s practice with data wrangling.</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a <code>tidyverse</code> code chunk that uses <em>at least <strong>3</strong></em> <code>tidyverse</code> functions. Do whatever you think makes the most sense.</li>
<li>All 3 of the functions should be within the SAME code chunk. That is, you should <em>not</em> have 3 separate chunks of code or 3 separate functions. It should be a cohesive paragraph of code (with multiple pipe operators).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s a list of some of the common <code>tidyverse</code> functions that you might want to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pivot_wider</code></li>
<li><code>pivot_longer</code></li>
<li><code>filter</code></li>
<li><code>separate</code></li>
<li><code>unite</code></li>
<li><code>mutate</code></li>
<li><code>select</code></li>
<li><code>arrange</code></li>
<li><code>rename</code></li>
<li><code>recode</code></li>
<li>any of the <code>join</code> functions (see cheatsheet for more)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Technically, <code>pivot_wider</code> and <code>pivot_longer</code> fit the bill, also. But we’re going to use these in the last part of the assignment, so please do not use those functions in this section.)</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Let’s make a plot with error bars!</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make a smaller data.frame that contains all the information you would need to make a bar graph (including information for error bars of +/- 1 standard deviation) for <em>at least <strong>two</strong></em> of your categorical variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, use the plotting code below and replace the missing values with your data so that you can actually make the bar graph!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s a HINT:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hardest part of this is trying to imagine what it is that you need!</li>
<li>You need a continuous variable that you can collapse into a value per level of each of your two categorical variables. Then you need to calculate everything needed for the error bars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the plotting code that you can copy/replace your data with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>XXX-1: correct data.frame
XXX-2: one of the two categorical variables
XXX-3: the summarized continuous variable
XXX-4: the second of the categorical variables
XXX-5: the value of the lower edge of the error bar
XXX-6: the value of the upper edge of the error bar

ggplot(data = XXX-1, aes(x = XXX-2, y = XXX-3, fill = XXX-4)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = XXX-5, ymax = XXX-6),
                position = position_dodge(width=.9),
                width = .2)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-wrangling-part-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Wrangling Part 2</h3>
<p>It’s very common to receive data in the wrong format. Either it comes to you as “long” but you need it to be “wide” or vice versa.</p>
<p>Both datasets now include information about time point. We’re going to use this information to convert to the other format!</p>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine if your data are currently in wide or long format. Make a note of this in your script.</li>
<li>Use the time information to go from wide to long or long to wide. Use <code>pivot_wider</code> or <code>pivot_longer</code>.</li>
<li>Rather than printing out the ENTIRE data.frame, print out the first 15 rows and the relevant columns using indexing.</li>
<li>Write a comment that describes what aspects of your data.frame become wide or long; that is, describe what it is you just performed.</li>
</ul>
