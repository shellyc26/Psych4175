<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This assignment is all about making figures. It’s going to be a bit free-form because when it comes to making figures, there are a <em>silly</em> number of options. Here are the conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must use the <code>ggplot2</code> package and syntax. This should <em>not</em> be practice for <code>base R</code>.</li>
<li>Your choice of variables must make sense for the type of plot you are making. That is, don’t give me a histogram for a dichotomous variable (that would just be 2 bars and super weird).</li>
<li>All figures must follow the basics of clear axis labels and titles! (<em>please</em> don’t make me take points off for this…). <strong>I will take points off if these are missing or not clear!</strong></li>
<li>NO PIE CHARTS!</li>
</ul>

<div id="visualizing-data-in-different-ways" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing data in different ways</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<p>Pick 2 variables from your dataset. Make <em>3 <strong>different</strong> figures</em> that show the relationship between these 2 variables. Your figures must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A theme</li>
<li>Make use of different colors (manually or with a color palette)</li>
<li>You need to pick the best of the 3 figures <strong>and explain why you think this is the case</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="explanation-vs.-clutter" class="section level2">
<h2>Explanation vs. Clutter</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a plot that uses at least 3 <code>geom</code>s. Make it as beautiful, publication-ready as you can.</li>
<li>Explain whether the extra <code>geom</code>s help explain your data or if it just clutters everything up. You may add an additional plot if you think it help explains your answer better (e.g., if you think a plot with only 2 <code>geom</code>s would be better, make that plot). An extra plot is not required. The explanation is required.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="multipanel-figures" class="section level2">
<h2>Multipanel Figures</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a multipanel figure. You will need at least 2 variables from your dataset to do this (likely more than 2). 2 of these variables need to be new (aka not used in section 1 of this assignment). After you’ve picked 2 new variables, you can start to use other variables that were already used. For instance, if you want 3 variables, 2 must be new and 1 can be from earlier in the assignment.</li>
<li>Multipanel can be in the form of subplots or it can be in the form of different figures woven together as a single figure. You choose.</li>
<li>Keep in mind the dimensions. We should be able to easily look at your figure on a standard laptop screen without having to scroll left/right very much.</li>
<li>Think about what format the data need to be in! Use <code>tidyverse</code> or whatever packages are necessary in order to wrangle your data into the appropriate format to plot.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="yahhoooooooo" class="section level3">
<h3>Yahhoooooooo!</h3>
<p>We’ll talk more about the theory of data viz later in the semester. But for now, you should feel comfortable plotting in the <code>ggplot2</code> world.</p>
<p>Go ahead and submit your code file to Canvas. If you used an outside dataset, please also submit that, too.</p>
