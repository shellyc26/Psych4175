<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This assignment is all about making figures. It’s going to be a bit free-form because when it comes to making figures, there are a <em>silly</em> number of options. Here are the conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must use the <code>ggplot2</code> package and syntax. This should <em>not</em> be practice for <code>base R</code>.</li>
<li>Your choice of variables must make sense for the type of plot you are making. That is, don’t give me a histogram for a dichotomous variable (that would just be 2 bars and super weird).</li>
<li>All figures must follow the basics of clear axis labels and titles! (<em>please</em> don’t make me take points off for this…). <strong>I will take points off if these are missing or not clear!</strong></li>
<li>NO PIE CHARTS!</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please use a RNotebook for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two main “sections” of this assignment. Make sure they each have an appropriate header.</li>
<li>All code must be contained within a code chunk. You are allowed to split up your code into many code chunks, or just have one large chunk per section. That is up to you. However, I do not want to see the code for an entire figure located outside of a chunk (unless you’re making a quick note or telling us what you’re doing – but the code outside of a chunk shouldn’t be evaluated).</li>
<li>Any explanations I ask for should be <em>outside</em> of a code chunk (aka formatted text). I personally would put this directly underneath the header, but it can come after the code chunk ends, as well. Whatever you prefer. However, I do not want to see any sentences as comments within a code chunk (e.g., <code>#a long sentence like this</code>). Comments within the code is fine in terms of describing what the code is doing. But when I ask for your opinion or an explanation of something, that needs to be formatted text.</li>
</ul>

<div id="visualizing-data-in-different-ways" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing data in different ways</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<p>Pick 2 variables from your dataset. Make <em>3 <strong>different</strong> figures</em> that show the relationship between these 2 variables. Your figures must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A theme</li>
<li>Make use of different colors (manually or with a color palette)</li>
<li>You need to pick the best of the 3 figures <strong>and explain why you think this is the case</strong></li>
<li>After you’ve picked your favorite, add a 3rd <em>variable</em> (not <code>geom</code>) to that plot (just to your favorite plot – not to all 3 plots). You can choose the dimension on which to add the 3rd variable (aka which aesthetic). Did adding the 3rd variable enhance this plot or does it detract? Explain why.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="explanation-vs.-clutter" class="section level2">
<h2>Explanation vs. Clutter</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a plot that uses at least 3 <code>geom</code>s. Make it as beautiful, publication-ready as you can.</li>
<li>Explain whether the extra <code>geom</code>s help explain your data or if it just clutters everything up. You may add an additional plot if you think it help explains your answer better (e.g., if you think a plot with only 2 <code>geom</code>s would be better, make that plot). An extra plot is not required. The explanation is required.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="yahhoooooooo" class="section level3">
<h3>Yahhoooooooo!</h3>
<p>We’ll talk more about the theory of data viz later in the semester. But for now, you should feel comfortable plotting in the <code>ggplot2</code> world.</p>
<p>Go ahead and submit your <code>.Rmd</code> and <code>.html</code> file to Canvas. If you used an outside dataset, please also submit that, too.</p>
