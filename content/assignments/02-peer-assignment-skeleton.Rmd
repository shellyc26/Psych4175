## How this works
This peer assignment is on the topic of *writing your own functions*. There are 4 problems, each ramping up in terms of difficulty and points:

- Easiest, 1 point
- A little harder, 2 points
- A little harder still, 3 points
- Hardest, 4 points

You need to edit the code chunks to create the correct output. **You will be graded on accuracy!** Specifically, you need to get the correct output.

DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE CHUNK PARAMETERS. The only things in this markdown file you should change are the name in the YAML header, and you should edit the actual code chunks. I will not ask you for any text responses, and I don't want you to change any of the RMarkdown parameters. 

You've all been doing great this semester, so I am confident you will do well on this, too. 

Let's get to it!

## Question 1 (1 point)

Below I am creating a vector of reaction times in milliseconds. 
```{r}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE

set.seed(1234)

rt <- sample(x = 100:3250, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
```

You are asked to analyze reaction time data for your lab. However, you remember from your cognitive neuroscience course(s) that at the bare minimum, it takes 250 milliseconds for light to reach the retina in your eye, be sent to visual cortex to be processed, and then a decision (the button pressing reaction time) to be made and executed via the motor cortex. You also know that your field considers any reaction time over 3000ms to be a sign that the participant isn't paying attention to the task at hand. 

Below is the outline of a function called `rtRemoval` that removes outliers at both ends. It takes 3 arguments:

- the vector of reaction times
- the minimum value of a plausible reaction time
- the maximum value of a plausible reaction time

The function is broken, however. Your job is to fix it such that the `cleanedRT` line returns a vector of reaction times that are now cleaned (meaning values too large or too small have been removed).

```{r}
rtRemoval <- (rt, min, max){
  rtKeep <- rt[rt > min & rt < max]
}

cleanedRT <- rtRemoval(rt = rt, min = 250, max = 3000)
cleanedRT
```

## Question 2 (2 points) 

Logistic regression is a type of regression that is used when your outcome (dependent variable) is binary, meaning it's coded as either a 0 or a 1. Logistic regression is great, but it has one problem. Rather than giving you "predicted values" of your outcome, it gives you something called "predicted logits". A logits is the natural log of **odds** (as in, betting style odds).

Let's say we're predicting PTSD, where someone with a confirmed PTSD diagnosis is coded as a 1 and someone without a confirmed PTSD diagnosis is coded as a 0. Now let's say that we want to know if stress (a continuous independent variable) predicts a PTSD diagnosis.

We could say: 
> For a 1-unit increase in stress, we predict a b1 increase in logits that Y = 1 (that there is PTSD)

But this isn't intuitive! Instead, we convert our logits back into odds using the formula $e^{b_1}$ where $e$ stands for Euler's number. To get $e$ in R, we would use `exp(1)`. 

Let's say our logistic regression output showed that $b_1 = .0812$. We could then run `exp(1)^.0812`, which is 1.083417. The interpretation of this value now is:

> For every 1-unit increase in stress, the odds of having a PTSD diagnosis increase by 8%

This is much easier to understand! Even still though, some people like thinking in terms of probabilities, rather than odds. So we can convert these odds back into probabilities using this formula $\frac{odds}{1+odds}$. Once in probabilities, the interpretation is:

> For every 1-unit increase in stress, the probability of having a PTSD diagnosis is ___

In the code below, let's make a function that will give you either the odds or the probability for a given logistic regression coefficient. 

It should take in 2 arguments:

- The coefficient to be transformed
- A logical argument whether you want to print out the odds or the probability. **The default of this argument should be `TRUE`.**

The function below is missing some key pieces. Your task is to fill it in so that this works. Once it works, test it with the a vector of coefficients (provided). 

**HINT**: all of the parentheses and brackets are correct here. You need to edit what goes inside of them. 

```{r}
logitConversion <- function(coef, want.odds){
  odds <- exp(1)^(coef)
  prob <- odds / (1+odds)
  
  if () {
    
  } else {
    
  }
}

# make a vector of coefficients to test -- don't change
vec <- seq(from = .01, to = 1.5, by = .15)

# below here, test out your logitConversion function on your new vector of coefficients
# run the function twice, first return the odds, then return the probabilities

```

## Question 3 (3 points) 

You magically become a professor overnight. Write a function that tells you what your students' final grades will be, if they get a ___ score on their final exam. 

This class is designed a little too easily where each assignment is just worth that amount of points and there are 250 points total. So we're not going to use this class (because seriously, it's just counting up raw points). We'll use a hypothetical class. In our hypothetical class:

- There are 3 exams total. The last one of these is the missing value.
- There are 6 homework assignments worth an equal amount.
- There is a participation grade.

Given a dataframe of scores for each student (provided), write a function that tells you what that student's final grade on the exam would be if they get a ___ score on the final exam, and a given set of weights for what percentage each part is worth. So for instance, you might want to calculate the final grade if the student gets a 70% on their final, and the weights are that each exam is worth 20%, homeworks are worth 30%, and participation is worth 10%. 

Assume all scores are out of a possible 100. `meanHW` refers to the mean grade on all 6 homework assignments -- again out of 100. 

Your function should be called `predictedGrades` and should take in 3 arguments:

- `data` should contain the data.frame of scores
- `finalExamGrade` contains what you expect their final exam grade will be 
- `weights` should be a vector that contain how much each part of the class is worth (e.g, exams worth 20% etc.). Vector should be in decimals (i.e., .2 for 20%)

You should return the entire data.frame with the last column being what they would get in the class. 

**HINTS**: 

- Think about how you're going to add in your final exam grade and how that aligns with your weights
- You'll likely need a short and sweet for loop
- If you decide to use the `sum` function, beware that it can be a little tricky. Specifically, if you use it on a data.frame, make sure you specify which columns of the data.frame. If you run into trouble with this, you can post on Slack.

```{r}
# create grades. IRL, you'd get this from Canvas
# don't change this
grades <- data.frame(Exam1 = c(77, 83, 80, 91, 88, 94, 62, 73, 85, 91),
                     Exam2 = c(90, 89, 84, 85, 72, 78, 75, 66, 97, 92),
                     meanHW = c(90, 77, 34, 92, 95, 87, 90, 85, 100, 100),
                     part = c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90, 85, 100, 100))

# write your function here. don't test it here, we'll do that after.






```

In the empty code chunk below, I now want you to run your function a total of 5 times with the following parameters:

1. Students get a 70% on the final, each exam is worth 20% of final grade, hws are worth 30% of final grade, and participation is worth 10% of final grade
2. Exams, hws, and participation are worth the same amount as above, but now students get an 80% on their final exam.
3. Same as above but now students get a 90% on their final exam
4. Students get an 80% on their final exam, but now each exam is worth 15%, hws are worth 35%, and participation is worth 20%
5. Students get an 80% on their final exam, but now each exam is worth 30%, hws are worth 8%, and participation is worth 2%


```{r}
# use your newly created function from above and test it out with varying parameters







```

_**Print the results of each run of this function so that I can see at least the final grades for all 5 of these scenarios**_

(Once you solve this, you might want to save it so that you can use it with future classes!)

## Question 4 (4 points) 

Write a function that takes in a data.frame and then automatically makes a scatter plot. Your plot should include:

- Points have a specific color (not black)
- Best fit line that's the same color as the points
- A theme
- Title and labeled axes based on the input arguments
- (you can include other things that make it pretty, if you want)

The name of the function should be `autoPlotting` for automatic plotting. There should be 3 arguments that you can name as you see fit:

1. The dataframe
2. Variable for x-axis
3. Variable for y-axis

**HINTS**: 

- Think about quotations and how this might matter. This goes all the way back to week 1 and data classes!
- You'll need to get a vector of the actual values. To do this, you can do `data.frame[[column.name]]`. Note the *double* brackets. 
- Look up the `paste()`, `paste0()`, and `cat()` functions. They're all very similar and you might find them helpful.
- The very first line of your function should be `require(ggplot2)`. I'm giving this to you.

```{r}
# write your function here. test it in the next code chunk below.


```

In the following empty code chunk, run your `autoPlot` function for the following:

1. `Sepal.Length` vs. `Sepal.Width` of the `iris` data.frame
2. `mpg` vs. `hp` of the `mtcars` data.frame
3. `brainwt` vs. `bodywt` of the `msleep` data.frame
4. `listings` vs. `sales` of the `txhousing` data.frame

Note that items 1 & 2 are built into base R. Items 3-4 are all data.frames that are part of the `ggplot2` package, so you can take a look at them if you're interested. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width='70%'}

```
