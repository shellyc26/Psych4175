<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>
<p>You must use a RNotebook for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections should have appropriate headers</li>
<li>All code must be contained within a code chunk. You are allowed to split up your code into many code chunks, or just have one large chunk per section. That is up to you. However, I do <em>not</em> want to see code located outside of a chunk (unless you’re making a quick note or telling us what you’re doing – but the code outside of a chunk shouldn’t be evaluated).</li>
<li>Any explanations I ask for should be <em>outside</em> of a code chunk (aka formatted text). I personally would put this directly underneath the header, but it can come after the code chunk ends, as well. Whatever you prefer. However, I do not want to see any sentences as comments within a code chunk (e.g., <code>#a long sentence like this</code>). Comments within the code is fine in terms of describing what the code is doing. But when I ask for your opinion or an explanation of something, that needs to be formatted text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must use the <code>ggplot2</code> package and syntax for all plotting. No plots in <code>base R</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis-testing" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct 3 hypothesis tests from your dataset. Choose any statistical tests that come from the <code>Comparing Means</code> lecture. For each of the 3 tests you need to:
<ul>
<li>Give a rationale for why you’re looking at this (does it theoretically make sense?; one sentence is OK)</li>
<li>State your hypothesis</li>
<li>Have a code chunk running the test and printing out the results</li>
<li>Make a plot that shows the effect for each of your 3 tests</li>
<li>Write 2-5 sentences interpreting the results including interpreting the p-value, and confidence intervals (if shown)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="current-state-of-academia-in-psychology-and-neuroscience" class="section level2">
<h2>Current State of Academia in Psychology and Neuroscience</h2>
<div class="list">
<p>Here’s your to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a few sentences about publication bias as discussed in the lecture. In it, describe what the “file drawer problem” is and how statistical power plays a role in publication bias.</li>
<li>Given what was presented in the <code>Power+</code> lecture, what do you think about the state of Psychology and Neuroscience research? Do you feel optimistic, hopeless, energized, etc.? Explain why. There is no right answer, I just want to hear your thoughts.</li>
<li>If you currently work in a lab (or have previously worked in a lab), describe 2 things that your lab could improve upon to better support rigorous Psych/Neuro research. If you do not work in a lab (and you have not previously worked in one), describe 2 things that you could do better with your assignments in this class that would better adhere to Open Science standards.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Side note: Lots of focus has been given to Psychology research, but all of these same problems are present in Neuroscience research, too. If you would like papers supporting this, feel free to reach out – I’m happy to send some over. Anyone studying behavior will run into these types of issues because humans are not rational beings (unlike what your economist friends might say…). I also just really love these topics, so feel free to reach out at any point if you want to know more or want to pursue these topics.</p>
<div id="whooooooooo" class="section level3">
<h3>Whooooooooo!</h3>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>Go ahead and submit your <code>.Rmd</code> and <code>.html</code> file to Canvas. If you used an outside dataset, please also submit that, too.</p>
