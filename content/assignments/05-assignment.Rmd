## Instructions
This assignment is all about making figures. It's going to be a bit free-form because when it comes to making figures, there are a *silly* number of options. Here are the conditions:

- You must use the `ggplot2` package and syntax. This should *not* be practice for `base R`.
- Your choice of variables must make sense for the type of plot you are making. That is, don't give me a histogram for a dichotomous variable (that would just be 2 bars and super weird).
- All figures must follow the basics of clear axis labels and titles! (*please* don't make me take points off for this...). **I will take points off if these are missing or not clear!** Do NOT use the defaults. You need to change the labels to make them publication-ready.
- NO PIE CHARTS!

## Visualizing data in different ways

:::list
Here's your to-do list:

Pick 2 variables from your dataset. Make *3 __different__ figures* that show the relationship between these 2 variables. Your figures must include the following:

  - A theme
  - Make use of different colors (manually or with a color palette)
  - You need to pick the best of the 3 figures **and explain why you think this is the case**
:::
  
## Explanation vs. Clutter
:::list
Here's your to-do list:

- Make a plot that uses at least 3 `geom`s. Make it as beautiful, publication-ready as you can.
- Explain whether the extra `geom`s help explain your data or if it just clutters everything up. You may add an additional plot if you think it help explains your answer better (e.g., if you think a plot with only 2 `geom`s would be better, make that plot). An extra plot is not required. The explanation is required.
:::

## Multipanel Figures
:::list
Here's your to-do list:

  - Create a multipanel figure. You will need at least 2 variables from your dataset to do this (likely more than 2). 2 of these variables need to be new (aka not used in section 1 of this assignment). After you've picked 2 new variables, you can start to use other variables that were already used. For instance, if you want 3 variables, 2 must be new and 1 can be from earlier in the assignment. 
  - Multipanel can be in the form of subplots or it can be in the form of different figures woven together as a single figure. You choose.
  - Keep in mind the dimensions. We should be able to easily look at your figure on a standard laptop screen without having to scroll left/right very much. 
  - Think about what format the data need to be in! Use `tidyverse` or whatever packages are necessary in order to wrangle your data into the appropriate format to plot.

### Yahhoooooooo!
We'll talk more about the theory of data viz later in the semester. But for now, you should feel comfortable plotting in the `ggplot2` world. 

Go ahead and submit your code file to Canvas. If you used an outside dataset, please also submit that, too.
