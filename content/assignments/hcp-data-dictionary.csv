NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Executive Function/Cognitive Flexibility (Dimensional Change Card Sort),CardSort_AgeAdj,"NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score. Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. The DCCS is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. DCCS is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time."
Penn Progressive Matrices: Number of Correct Responses (PMAT24_A_CR),Cognition,Fluid Intelligence (Penn Progressive Matrices),PMAT24_A_CR,"Penn Matrix Test (PMAT): Number of Correct Responses. The PMAT measures fluid intelligence via non-verbal reasoning using an abbreviated version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices Form A developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012).  Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing.  The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern.  The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty.  However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row."
NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Processing Speed (Pattern Completion Processing Speed),ProcSpeed_AgeAdj,"NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (PCT): Age-Adjusted Scale Score. Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. The PCT is a measure of speed of processing, which is considered a 'fluid ability' because it steadily improves (time to complete task decreases) throughout childhood and adolescence, then begins to decline in adulthood. This test for ages 7-85 asks participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not. The items are designed to be simple to most purely measure processing speed. "
NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Working Memory (List Sorting),ListSort_AgeAdj,"This task assesses working memory and requires the participant to sequence different visually- and orally-presented stimuli. Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with both a sound clip and written text that name the item. The task has two different conditions: 1-List and 2-List. In the 1-List condition, participants are required to order a series of objects (either food or animals) in size order from smallest to largest. In the 2-List condition, participants are presented both food and animals and are asked to report the food in size order, followed by the animals in size order. Children ages 3-6 have four practice items in each condition: two practice items in which the images appear simultaneously on the screen and two practice items in which the images briefly 'flash' sequentially on the screen. Participants ages 7-85 have two practice items, both 'flashing' in each condition. Different instructions are provided for 3-6 and 7-85 year olds in English and for 3-6, 7-17 and 18-85 year olds in Spanish."
NIH Toolbox General Life Satisfaction Survey: Unadjusted Scale Score,Emotion,"Psychological Well-being (Positive Affect, Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose)",LifeSatisf_Unadj,"Life Satisfaction is a concept within the Psychological Well-Being subdomain of Emotion. Life Satisfaction is one's cognitive evaluation of life experiences and is concerned with whether people like their lives or not. Life satisfaction includes both general (e.g., my life is going well) and domain-specific (e.g., I am satisfied with my family life) aspects. This self-report measure for adults (ages 18 and above) is a 10-item calibrated scale comprised of items from the Satisfaction with Life Scale  and the Students' Life Satisfaction Scale.  It assesses global feelings and attitudes about one's life."
NIH Toolbox Meaning and Purpose Survey: Unadjusted Scale Score,Emotion,"Psychological Well-being (Positive Affect, Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose)",MeanPurp_Unadj,"Meaning and Purpose is a concept within the Psychological Well-Being subdomain of Emotion. Meaning and Purpose is characterized by the extent to which people feel their life matters or makes sense. This self-report measure for adults (ages 18 and above) is a CAT comprised of items from the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Life Engagement Test, the MHI, and the FACIT-Sp."
