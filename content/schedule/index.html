<p>Here’s your roadmap for this course!</p>
<p>Each topic has 2 primary sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/lectures/"><strong>Lectures</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This contains the lecture slides and video recordings of these lectures. You should watch the videos and follow along for each topic that is assigned per week.</li>
<li><a href="/practice/"><strong>Practice</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains an interactive lesson that reinforces the principles that were discussed in the corresponding lecture. They also tend to go through more detail. Go through these <em>after</em> watching the lecture videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have watched the lectures and completed the practices for the week’s assigned topics, you will complete an assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignment</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for each assignment. All items in the green to-do list boxes are part of the assignment. <strong>Assignments are due by 9:00am on the day they’re listed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: You should follow this general process each day:</p>
<ul>
