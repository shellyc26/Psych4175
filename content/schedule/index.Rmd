Here's your roadmap for this course!

- [**Lectures**](/lectures/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This contains the lecture slides and video recordings of these lectures. You should watch the videos and follow along for each topic that is assigned per week. 
- [**Practice**](/practice/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains an interactive lesson that reinforces the principles that were discussed in the corresponding lecture. They also tend to go through more detail. Go through these *after* watching the lecture videos. 

After you have watched the lectures and completed the practices for the week's assigned topics, you will complete an assignment.

- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for each assignment. All items in the green to-do list boxes are part of the assignment. **Assignments are due by 2:30pm on the _following_ TUESDAY.** Ex: Assignment 1 covers the topic from Week 1, but is due on Tuesday 9/22 at 2:30pm.

- **Quizzes** (<i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-lg"></i>): There are 4 quizzes total, and they will be administered on Canvas. **Quizzes are due by 2:30pm on the _following_ TUESDAY.** Ex: Quiz 1 covers the topic of "Distributions" from Week 6 (10/20 - 10/22), but is due on Tuesday 10/27. 

:::note
**tl;dr**: You should follow this general process each day:

- Do everything on the Lectures (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>) page
- Work through the practice set (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>) page
- Complete the assignment (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>) or quiz (<i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-lg"></i>)
