#### Get Out, Again

Like last time, someone else has already made some great tutorials, so please do those. Please complete the two lessons linked in the **"You Try"** boxes below.

  1. The first one introduces the concept of "tidy data" and will focus on going from long to wide format and vice versa.
  
:::note
This tutorial will use the functions `spread()` and `gather()`. These are from an **older** version of `R`! They recently renamed these functions to `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer`. They do the same things and the concepts are the same. But the function names and argument names have changed.

  2. The second one focuses on separating and uniting columns.
  
:::puzzle
**You try!** Complete the following tutorials:

  1. [Reshape Date](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4.1)
  2. [Separate and Unite Columns](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4.2)

:::fyi
If you think you will be taking multiple data.frames or data sets and combining them into one larger data.frame, then I suggest [this additional tutorial on joining data sets](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4.3). It's not required, but if this is something you'll be doing a lot of, I suggest getting some practice doing it!

#### You're doing great!
We all go in and out of productivity. It's totally fine! Just be kind to yourself. And if you need to take a break, take one!
