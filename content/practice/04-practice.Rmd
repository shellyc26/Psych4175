## Data.frames
A **data.frame** is basically a spreadsheet. It's 2-dimensional (rows & columns). Remember our `starwars` dataset? 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
empire <- starwars

empire <- empire[c(1:5, 10, 13, 14, 19, 21), c(1:3, 8, 10, 11)]
empire$species <- factor(empire$species)

kable(empire)
```

Each row has `6` pieces of information and each column has `10` observations. 

<span class='medium'>**Let's make our own data.frame!**</span> 

:::note
For the most part, you will be importing your data from somewhere else. We'll cover how to import data shortly in [topic #7](/lectures/07-lecture) of "The Basics".
:::

Making a data.frame has the following formatting (or syntax):

```{r df-code, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
newDf <- data.frame(vector1,
                    vector2,
                    vector3)
```

```{r decorate-df-code, echo=FALSE}
decorate("df-code", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("newDf",
        background = "#686DE07D") %>% 
  flair("data.frame",
        background = "#ff79797D") %>%
  flair_rx("vector",
        background = "#FFFF007D") %>% 
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

`r emo::ji("index_pointing_up")` Here we have:

1. What we want to name our data.frame: `newDf` in <span class='color-light-6'>blue</span>
2. The actual words `data.frame` in <span class='color=light-1'>red</span>
3. The vectors we want included in <font style="color:#FFFF00">yellow</font>

In order to effectively create a new data.frame from multiple vectors, each vector should have the same number of items! If it doesn't, R will ususally fill it in with the missing variable class `NA`.

Remember these variables?

```{r}
ids <- c("ID1", "ID2", "ID3", "ID4", "ID5") # character
state <- c("Missouri", "Iowa", "Missouri", "Idaho", "Maine") # character/factor
smoker <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) # logical
age <- c(20, 18, 32, 25, 25) # numeric
```

Let's turn them into a data.frame. 

```{r dem-code, include=FALSE}
demographics <- data.frame(ids,
                           state,
                           smoker,
                           age)
```

```{r decorate-dem-code, echo=FALSE}
decorate("dem-code") %>% 
  flair("demographics",
        background = "#686DE07D") %>% 
  flair("data.frame",
        background = "#ff79797D") %>%
  flair("ids",
        background = "#FFFF007D") %>% 
  flair("state",
        background = "#FFFF007D") %>%
  flair("smoker",
        background = "#FFFF007D") %>%
  flair("age",
        background = "#FFFF007D") %>%
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

Now that it's a data.frame called `demographics`, it looks like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(demographics)
```

If you're creating a new data.frame from vectors, you can easily adjust the column names. 

```{r}
demographics <- data.frame(SubjectID = ids,
                           Location = state,
                           SmokerTF = smoker,
                           SubjectAge = age)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(demographics)
```

:::puzzle
**You try!** Make a data.frame from the following SAT/ACT variables we've been working with. Call the entire data.frame `scores`. Include the following variables and make sure they have the following as their column names:

- Age
- SAT_Verbal
- SAT_Quant
- SAT_Total
- SAT_Scaled
- ACT
- Avg_Scores
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("learnr",
                    url = "https://shelly-cooper.shinyapps.io/04-learnr-app1/",
                    id = "learnr-04-app1")

```

## Indexing Data.frames
In our [last practice](/practice/03-practice) session, we went over indexing a 1-dimensional vector. For data.frames, the process is very similar, but now we have to account for 2 dimensions!

```{r index-code, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
data[ROWS, COLUMNS]
```

```{r decorate-index-code, echo=FALSE}
decorate("index-code", eval=FALSE) %>% 
  flair("data", background = "#686DE07D") %>% 
  flair("ROWS", background = "#ff79797D") %>% 
  flair("COLUMNS", background = "#badc587d") %>% 
  flair("[", background = "#FFFF007D") %>% 
  flair("]", background = "#FFFF007D")
```

Let's take a look back at `demographics`
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(demographics)
```

What if I wanted the 4th row, 3rd column? 
```{r}
demographics[4,3]
```

How about the location of subjects 1 through 3?
```{r}
demographics[1:3, 2]
```

If you want **all** of either rows or columns, just leave it blank. But don't forget the comma!

```{r}
# all the columns for row 2
demographics[2,]

# all the rows of column 4
demographics[,4]
```

Earlier in this practice, I asked you to run the line `head(scores)`. Using `head()` is just a shortcut for `scores[1:6,]`! `head(scores)` is a nice way to very quickly view a data.frame (especially really big data.frames!)

#### What if you don't know the column number? 
Use the `$` sign! This is really, really, REALLY helpful! Plus, autocomplete is magical. 

```{r}
demographics$Location
```

**You try!** Let's practice using the `empire` dataset. (If you've forgotten what it looks like, scroll to the top of this page) Follow the directions above each code chunk!
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("learnr",
                    url = "https://shelly-cooper.shinyapps.io/04-learnr-app2/",
                    id = "learnr-04-app2")

```

#### You're chugging along and doing wonderfully!
