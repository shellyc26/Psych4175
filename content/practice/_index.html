<p><em>Almost</em> every lecture has a corresponding, interactive practice that you will work through <strong><em>after</em></strong> watching the lecture.</p>
<p>You’ll see color coded boxes. Puzzle icons (like below) indicate that it’s your turn to give things a shot. There are also a couple of quiz questions scattered throughout.</p>
<div class="puzzle">
<p><strong>Your turn</strong>: This is where instructions for the interactive practices will be.</p>
