<p>ach class session has an interactive lesson that you will work through <strong><em>after</em></strong> doing the readings and watching the lecture. These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use <strong>ggplot2</strong> and other packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong> to create beautiful and truthful visualizations with R.</p>
<p>Interactive code sections look like this. Make changes in the text box and click on the green “Run Code” button to see the results. Sometimes there will be a button with a hint or solution.</p>
